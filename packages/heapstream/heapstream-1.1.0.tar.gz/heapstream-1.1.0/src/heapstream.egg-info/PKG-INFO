## Setup & Configuration<a id="setup--configuration"></a>

### Supported Language Versions<a id="supported-language-versions"></a>

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation<a id="installation"></a>

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install heapstream
```

## Authentication<a id="authentication"></a>

### Basic Authentication<a id="basic-authentication"></a>

The Heapstream API uses Basic Authentication.

You need to provide your username and password when initializing the SDK.

#### Setting the Username and Password<a id="setting-the-username-and-password"></a>

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the username and password as follows:

```py
Heapstream(
    username="YOUR_USERNAME",
    password="YOUR_PASSWORD",
    timeout=10000
)
```

If you need to set or update the username and password after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_basic_auth("YOUR_USERNAME", "YOUR_PASSWORD")
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout<a id="setting-a-custom-timeout"></a>

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from heapstream import Heapstream

sdk = Heapstream(timeout=10000)
```

# Sample Usage<a id="sample-usage"></a>

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from heapstream import Heapstream

sdk = Heapstream(
    username="YOUR_USERNAME",
    password="YOUR_PASSWORD",
    timeout=10000
)

result = sdk.project.list_projects()

print(result)

```
