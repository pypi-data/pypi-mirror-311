MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.

MapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.

MapProxy is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.

Changes
-------
3.1.3 2024-11-26
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maintenance:

  - Several dependencies for the tests and GitHub actions have been updated
  - Spelling and grammar mistakes in the documentation corrected

Fixes:

  - The chmod to update file permissions is now only called if the file was freshly created
  - A bug with clipping polygons that become multi polygons due to the clipping is now fixed


3.1.2 2024-11-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maintenance:

  - Several dependencies for the tests and github actions have been updated

Fixes:

  - Metadata URLs are now required to have a `url`, `type` and `format`
  - The layers of a wms `req` are now correctly splitted at `,` for validation
  - The validation for seeding configs is fixed
  - Single color tiles are now created with configured file_permissions


3.1.1 2024-11-15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maintenance:

  - Werkzeug version is no longer pinned and can be chosen freely.

Fixes:

  - The permission handling for file locks now also sets permissions on the files not just on the directories.


3.1.0 2024-10-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:

  - Add new config parameters `file_permissions` and `directory_permissions` to set file and directory
    permissions on newly created cache files and directories.

Maintenance:

  - Dependency updates

Fixes:

  - Fix transparency in TMS demo page.


3.0.1 2024-08-27
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes:

  - Fix capabilities links in demo page and config template
  - Trivy report format


3.0.0 2024-08-27
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Breaking:

  - Add proper XML Exception when service parameter disabled / invalid or missing
    In the past MapProxy returned WMS Capabilities when no explicit service parameter was given in
    GetCapabilities requests. With this change, an OGC exception will be returned instead.
    Invalid service types now also return a proper exception instead of an `internal error`.
    Besides, the status code of exception responses now have a 400 or 500 code instead of 200
    for better conformity.

Maintenance:

  - Add test for seeding sqlite cache
  - Documentation updates and clarifications
  - Dependency updates

Fixes:

  - Fix gh-pages workflow


2.2.0 2024-07-24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:

  - Add timeout to SQLite connect for geopackages. This helps against locking exceptions
  - Improvement of documentation, typos, wrong cli commands, old python2 stuff
  - The WMTS capabilites will now advertise the WMS GetLegendGraphic as a LegendURL if both services are active
  - It is possible now to configure LegendURLs that should be shown in the WMTS capabilities
  - A new method for plugins to intercept and modify requests made to MapProxy was added.

Maintenance:

  - Removal of debian package information
  - Fix docs workflow

Fixes:

  - Remove import of the packaging library that does not appear in the `install_requires`
  - Only install and use `importlib_resources` in python 3.8
