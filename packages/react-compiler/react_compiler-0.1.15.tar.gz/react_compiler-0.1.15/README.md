ReACT is a set of compiler techniques that generate optimized code for dense and sparse tensor expressions. Check out our paper: [ReACT: Redundancy-Aware Code Generation for Tensor Expressions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3559009.3569685).

A Python-based version of ReACT is available to try online: https://tongzhou80.github.io/react-web/index.html!

An MLIR-based (C++) implementation of ReACT has also been included in the [COMET compiler](https://github.com/pnnl/COMET).
