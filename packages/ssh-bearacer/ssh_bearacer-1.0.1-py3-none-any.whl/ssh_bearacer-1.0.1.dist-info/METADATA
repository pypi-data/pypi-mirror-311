    "ssh_port": 22,
    "ssh_username": "your_username",
    "ssh_key": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
}

deployment_manager = DeploymentManager(ssh_config=ssh_config)
deployment_manager.run(
    local_commands=[
        "git checkout develop",
        "git pull origin develop",
        "bun run build",
        "rsync -avP .output user@remote_host:~/app_directory",
    ],
    remote_commands=[
        "cd app_directory",
        "docker-compose up -d --build",
