<h1>The graphical user interface (GUI)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-graphical-user-interface-gui" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The graphical user interface lets the user manually examine a drift scan.
This is done through a graphical interface that enables a user to select
specific locations on the drift scan they would like to fit. The gui also
allows the user to view changes made to a drift scan and adjust them
accordingly.  A walk through of the GUI is given below.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-landing-page">
<h1>The landing page<a class="headerlink" href="#the-landing-page" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The first page you see when the GUI is initiated is the landing page.
This page contains the different options the GUI offers with regards to viewing
and processing your data. You can edit your drift scan (e.g. perform fitting),
edit your timeseries (e.g. manually remove outliers) and view plots of the
processed data. A brief summary of each of these options is given below.</p>
<img alt="landing page image." src="../_images/landing.png" />
</section>
<section id="edit-driftscan">
<h1>Edit driftscan<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-driftscan" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The “Edit Driftscan” button opens up the drift scan editting window.
This page shows the basic layout of the GUI. On the left is the “Scan properties”
tab, this tab consists of a curated list of some of the drift scan properties found in
the drift scan fits file on the observed source. On the second tab, “Fit window”, is
information used for the actual fitting. This is currently hidden here but will be
shown in the next image. We also have a section to display all the text
outputs resulting from running operations on the program, as well as buttons to
open a file, view, reset and save drift scan fitting information. On the right is the
plot window where the drift scan data is displayed. The next plot shows what the GUI
looks like once a drift scan file is opened.</p>
<img alt="drift scan editting page image." src="../_images/home.png" />
<p>Upon opening a file, the drift scan data is loaded onto the plot window. The top plot
displays the current drift scan, and the bottom one is a place holder for the residuals.
This operation also toggles the display to the “Fit window” mentioned previously. On this
window is the information we need to fit the beam/beams of the drift scan. To toggle between
different drift scans we use the “curren plot selection” toggle.</p>
<img alt="loaded scan image." src="../_images/loaded_scan.png" />
<p>To beginning fitting the drift scan, one can click on the drift scan at the location at
which the fit is to be done as shown in the following image.</p>
<img alt="base selection image." src="../_images/base_select.png" />
<p>The code is hot wired to process fitting the baseline and peak differently. This is
controlled by the “Fit Location” toggle. If you want to fit the baseline, the toggle
needs to be on “Base”. Then once you are happy with the locations you clicked on or
selected on the plot, you use the “Fit data” button to initiate the actual
fit to the baseline blocks selected in the previous step.  This creates a new plot
with the baseline drift removed as shown below.</p>
<img alt="base corrected image." src="../_images/base_corrected.png" />
<p>The default baseline fit is a 1st order polynomial, however, this can be adjusted accordingly
using the “Fit order” toggle. There are also options to filter the data (smoothing/removing RFI)
if needed, with a smoothing window provided to cater for that. After the baseline is corrected
the equation of a straight line as well ast the points used for the fit are displayed
as well. When fitting the peak, the peak selection works the same way as the baseline
selection with the exception
that the “Fit Location” toggle is set to “Peak”. Depending on where you want to fit
around the peak, you need to select peak fitting points as shown below.</p>
<img alt="peak selection image." src="../_images/peak_select.png" />
<p>Once you are happy with the selection points, you press “Fit data” again so the program
fits the peak of the corrected data. This will create a new fit overlayed on the plot
with information on the peak fit and its error. It is this value that we use to calculate
the PSS or the source flux depending on the target object under investigation.</p>
<img alt="peak fit image." src="../_images/peak_fit.png" />
<p>When you are happy with the fit, you need to save it using the “Save” button. This saves the
changes made to the current session, in this example, we are saving changes made to the
LCP ON SCAN drift scan. The minute you press save, any previous data you had previously
processed on this observation for this scan will be replaced by the changes you made.
This will also update the previous image you had. If you want to make changes to other
sessions as well you can use the “Current plot selection” toggle to change to new
drift scan session and load a different set of data. It is imperative to remember that
for any changes to be save you need to click on the “Save” button for each session or
each different drift scan. To view the values that will be modified
on the database, click on “View fit”. At this point the changes are still local to your
session, so to make the changes permanent on the database you need to click on “Save to
DB”. This updates the database and makes your changes permanent. A popup
will appear and ask if you are sure you want to continue modifying the values
in the database, If you are, you click yes and end your session. If you want
for example to revert to the previously automated fit that you accidentally
modified using the GUI, you need to go into the database and delete
the observation from there, then run the code again in automated mode to re-process
the automated fit.</p>
<img alt="save to db image." src="../_images/db_save.png" />
</section>
<section id="edit-time-series">
<h1>Edit Time series<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-time-series" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Currently this feature is not fully operational. The plan is to have this gui
allow you to modify timeseries data manually. Right now, all you can do is view
the timeseries data and view the drift scan plots responsible for the points
on the time series data.</p>
<p>Opening a database in “Edit Time series” lets you plot any timeseries on the data
provided. For this example I’m plotting observed date vs PSS.</p>
<img alt="edit timeseries plot." src="../_images/db.png" />
<p>To view the drift scan plots that provided a specific point on the timeseries you
click on the point in the timeseries and a popup html will show up with all the
processed scans for that specific point.</p>
<img alt="html insert image of point clicked." src="../_images/insert.png" />
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In future releases the GUI will be adapted to also handle timeseries analysis.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="view-plots">
<h1>View plots<a class="headerlink" href="#view-plots" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>View plots lets you view the thumbnails of all the plots made by the code for each
observed object.</p>
<img alt="html insert image of point clicked." src="../_images/plot_views.png" />
<p>Selecting the object name from a dropdown list provies a tile view
of all the plots made for that current object. Clickin on the tiles
provides a zoomed in image of the thumbnail.</p>
<img alt="html insert image of point clicked." src="../_images/plots.png" />
<p>Currently this does not work well when there is a lot of data
because the page takes a long time to load. In future work this will be modified
for effecient page loading.</p>
