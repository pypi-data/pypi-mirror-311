### List Installed Packages

#### With pipx

```console
piplexed list
```
Outputs similar information to `pipx list`, albeit minus the names of the binaries, in a rich table format.

```console
piplexed list --tree
```

An optional tree flag can be passed for a tree view (less useful if there are a lot of packages)

## ‚ùì Why piplexed

The name **piplexed** is a play on words, it contains the letters for pipx and I was also mildly perplexed trying to find a simpler way to identify outdated pipx installed packages, only to discover it didn't exist. Put the two together and well.... you get the idea (naming things is hard after all!).
For a longer answer see the [documentation](https://aj-white.github.io/piplexed/Why-piplexed/).


## ü©π Caveats

**Piplexed** is a project that I built for my workflow, but it may not work for everyone.

It is only intended to work for packages that are installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org), so will not work for local packages or git/url etc.
