## 0.1.0

### Fixed

- If a non-PyPI package (for example a local wheel) is installed with pipx, a `NoSuchProjectError` results due it not being on PyPI. This has been resolved by using the pipx metadata json file to determine if the package was installed from a non-PyPi source and not request it's details from PyPI

### Added

### Changed
