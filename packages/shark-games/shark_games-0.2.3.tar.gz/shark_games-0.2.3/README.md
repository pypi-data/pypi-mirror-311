# shark-games

Games bot for Sharkey
hosted on @games@woem.men

*It might work also on other \*key software, but please keep in mind that it is build around Sharkey's Rate limits and API specifications and so that is the only supported software.*

## Usage
@ping help

note that the ping can be placed anywhere indipendently from the text.

## Hosting
*this maybe gets replaced with proper docs*

### Prerequisite

Python 3.12

**PLEASE NOTE** only python 3.12 is supported currently. It might work also with other versions, but that isn't on the priority list now. As soon as it is finished, I will update the requirements to support also other versions.

1. Navigate where you want the config save directory to be created

2. Create a virtual environment
```
$ python3 -m venv venv
```
3. Activate the environment
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install
```
$ pip install -U wheel
$ pip install -U shark_games 
```
5. Setup
```
$ sharkgames setup
```
Follow the setup guide provided

6. Run
```
$ sharkgames run
```

## Update

Make sure the bot isn't running!

**IMPORTANT** Always check changelog whenever updating. There might be instanced where the automatic update of config doesn't work, for example if you need to enter a value. In that case you need to manually change the config or set up the bot again.

1. Navigate to the directory where you set it up

2. Activate the environment
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Update
```
$ pip install -U wheel
$ pip install -U shark_games 
```
4. Run the bot
```
sharkgames run
```
You should see a `Updatingâ€¦` dialog if there is a config update being done.

## Development

This guide assumes you have already a virtual enviroment set up and activated

1. Build
`python3 -m build`

2. Load the package
`pip install --force-reinstall dist/shark_games-v.v.v-py3-none-any.whl`
*replace v.v.v with the actual version number. The version number can be found in ./shark_games/__init__.py*

3. Test pypi *this isn't mandatory for contributors, you can safely ignore this* **PLEASE NOTE:** make sure only one version is inside the dist directroy
`python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`

4. Run the tests
`test test test` *not available yet*

### Naming etc.
Simply because python doesn't work with -, the package is named shark_games. Commands use sharkgames (for setup etc.) While the rest shark-games should be used.

## Post install config options

The config is saved in `./shark-games/config.json`.

### config options
- `"interval"`(int): how often it checks for new notes. Setting it higher makes each request take longer, but when setting it to low it reduces the amount of requests it can process (the rate limit allows one API call per second). Default: 10, Minimum: 2
- `"warnInvalidCommand"` (bool): if it should warn the user when an invalid command is issued. I highly recommend against the usage, as in case of a thread (where responses would automatically ping the bot) it would mean a lot of useless and annoying warnings. Default: false
<!---`"RateLimitHandling"` (dict):
    - `"max_retries"` (int): How many times it should retry after a rate limit got hit. Default: 5
    - `"base_delay"` (float): In case the rate limit does not answer a time when retry, it will try to wait in a exponential way. This is the minimum delay from where it starts. Default: 1.0
    - `"max_delay"` (float): This is the maximum delay in case of a non specified wait time, as described above. Default: 45.0
    - `"base_request_delay"` (float): How long it should wait between each request. This is used because based on my testing, it allows only one request every second, and if you hit the rate limit too often it will block you (temporarily via a `503`). After a first rate limit hit, this will automatically increase, though this increase will not be reflected in the config afterwards. Default: 1.0-->

### Rate limit configuring

The rate limit config file is saved in `.shark-games/rate-limits.json`. It is based on Sharkeys limits from the [source](https://activitypub.software/TransFem-org/Sharkey/-/tree/develop/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints?ref_type=heads), where for each endpoint in `meta` the `limit` section indicates the parameters. Only the actually used endpoints are actually configured in this software.
