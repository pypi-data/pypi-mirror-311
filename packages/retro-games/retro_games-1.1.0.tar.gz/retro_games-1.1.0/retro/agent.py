class Agent:
    """Represents a character in the game. To create an Agent, define a new
    class with some of the attributes and methods below. You may change any of
    the Agent's attributes at any time, and the result will immediately be 
    visible in the game.

    After you create your Agents, add them to the ``Game``, either when it is created
    or using ``Game.add_agent`` later on. Then the Game will take care of calling 
    the Agent's methods at the appropriate times. 

    Attributes:
        position: (Required) The character's ``(int, int)`` position on the game
            board. 
        character: (Required unless display is ``False``.) A one-character string 
            which will be displayed at the Agent's position on the game board. 
        name: (Optional) If an agent has a name, it must be unique within the game. 
            Agent names can be used to look up agents with 
            :py:meth:`retro.game.Game.get_agent_by_name`. 
        color (str): (Optional) The agent's color. 
            `Available colors <https://blessed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/colors.html>`_.
        display: (Optional) When ``False``, the Agent will not be displayed on the 
            board. This is useful when you want to create an agent which will be displayed
            later, or when you want to create an agent which acts on the Game indirectly, 
            for example by spawning other Agents. Defaults to True.
        z: (Optional) When multiple Agents have the same position on the board, the 
            Agent with the highest ``z`` value will be displayed. 
            The Game is played on a two-dimensional (x, y) board, but you can think of 
            ``z`` as a third "up" dimension. Defaults to 0.
