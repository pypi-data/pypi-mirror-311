Open source projects thrive on collaboration, but their openness comes with
risks. Contributors may unknowingly or intentionally exhibit suspicious
behaviors, such as:
- Frequent timezone changes in their commit metadata.
- Working at unusual hours or during public holidays.
- Unusual patterns in commit activity.

These anomalies could indicate automation scripts, compromised accounts, or
malicious actions.

**Defected** is a CLI tool designed to help maintainers detect and flag
suspicious commit patterns. By analyzing Git logs, Defected provides insights
into contributorsâ€™ behaviors, helping ensure the security and integrity of
your project.

## Problem Statement

Risks in Open Source Collaboration:
1. **Frequent Timezone Changes**:
   - Automation scripts or account misuse can result in rapid changes in
     timezone metadata.
2. **Unusual Working Hours**:
   - Commits made during public holidays or odd hours may indicate suspicious
     activity.
3. **Behavioral Anomalies**:
   - Patterns of activity inconsistent with normal contributor behavior could
     point to automation or malicious intent.

Manually detecting these patterns is tedious and impractical for large
projects.

## Objective

Defected addresses these challenges by:
- **Detecting frequent timezone changes** in commit metadata.
- **Highlighting contributors** with irregular commit patterns.
- **Flagging potential risks** for maintainers to investigate.
- Providing **clear and exportable reports** for further analysis.

## Features

1. **Easy-to-Use CLI**:
   - Installable via PyPI, Defected is simple to run directly from your
     terminal.
2. **Commit Metadata Analysis**:
   - Extracts author, email, date, and timezone data from Git logs.
3. **Timezone Change Detection**:
   - Flags contributors exceeding a configurable threshold of timezone
     changes.
4. **Customizable Options**:
   - Adjust thresholds, filter suspicious results.
5. **Exportable Reports**:
   - Saves results in CSV format for further analysis.

## Installation

Install Defected using **pip**:

```bash
$ pip install defected
```

## Usage

Defected provides a single command-line interface with subcommands.
You can list all the available commands by using:

```bash
$ defected -h
```

### Available Commands

#### Analyze

The `analyze` sub-command help you to find suspicious contributors:
```bash
$ defected analyze [OPTIONS]
```

List all the available options by using:
```bash
$ defected analyze -h
```

##### Examples

Analyze the current repository for timezone changes:

```bash
defected analyze
```

Clone and analyze a remote repository.
Analyze a remote repository by providing its URL:

```bash
defected analyze --repo https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

Filter only suspicious results. Display and export only
contributors flagged as suspicious:

```bash
defected analyze --only-suspicious
```

##### Examples Output

Terminal output:
```
Extracting Git logs...
150 commits extracted.

Analyzing timezones with a threshold of 2 timezone changes...

Showing only suspicious results:
            author             email      total_commits  unique_timezones  timezone_changes  suspicious
0    Alice Smith    alice@example.com     45              3                4                True
1    Bob Johnson    bob@example.com       30              2                3                True

Saving analysis to 'timezone_analysis.csv'...

```

Or CSV output:
| author       | email             | total_commits | unique_timezones | timezone_changes | suspicious |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Alice Smith  | alice@example.com | 45            | 3                 | 4                | True       |
| Bob Johnson  | bob@example.com   | 30            | 2                 | 3                | True       |

#### `inspect` Command

The `inspect` command in **Defected** allows maintainers to analyze the
activity of a specific contributor by filtering their Git commits and
providing detailed information. It helps investigate anomalies by summarizing
timezone usage and generating a timeline of timezone changes.

This command can be used in addition of the `analyze` command to collect
more details once a suspicious activity has been detected.

The `inspect` command is designed for deeper investigation into an individual
contributor's activity. It provides:
1. A detailed breakdown of the time zones from which the contributor worked.
2. A timeline of timezone changes with timestamps, highlighting irregular
   patterns.

##### Usage

```bash
defected inspect [OPTIONS]
```

Inspect by user name. Analyze all contributions made by a user named
"Alice Smith" in the current repository:

```bash
defected inspect --user "Alice Smith"
```

Inspect by email. Analyze all contributions made by a contributor with the
email `alice@example.com`:

```bash
defected inspect --email alice@example.com
```

Analyze a remote repository. Clone and analyze a remote repository while
inspecting a specific user:

```bash
defected inspect --repo https://github.com/example/repo.git --user "Alice Smith"
```

##### Output

The `inspect` command generates two primary outputs:

1. **Timezone Usage Summary**:
   - A table summarizing the time zones used by the contributor and the number
     of commits per time zone.
   - Saved to `<output>_usage.csv`.

2. **Timezone Change Log**:
   - A detailed timeline of timezone changes, showing the date and time of
     each change and the time zones involved.
   - Saved to `<output>_changes.csv`.

##### Examples

```text
Commits found for Alice Smith: 50

Timezone usage:
  timezone  commit_count
0    +0100            20
1    -0500            15
2    +0200            10
3    +0000             5

Timezone change log:
From +0100 at 2024-11-27 13:00:00 to +0200 at 2024-11-28 14:00:00
From +0200 at 2024-11-28 14:00:00 to -0500 at 2024-11-29 15:30:00
From -0500 at 2024-11-29 15:30:00 to +0000 at 2024-11-30 10:00:00

Detailed results saved to 'inspect_results_usage.csv' and 'inspect_results_changes.csv'.
```

##### Benefits

- **Targeted Analysis**: Focus on individual contributors for detailed investigations.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identify unusual patterns, such as frequent timezone changes.
- **Exportable Data**: Provides structured data for further analysis and reporting.

## Real world use case

[JiaT75](https://github.com/JiaT75) and the [xz Backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor)

### Background

In February 2024, a contributor named **[JiaT75](https://github.com/JiaT75)**
managed to introduce a backdoor into the popular compression utility **xz**.
This backdoor could have allowed unauthorized access to systems using the
library, creating a serious security risk.

Upon investigation, it was discovered that **JiaT75** exhibited **suspicious behavior**:
1. They made commits from multiple, rapidly-changing timezones over a short
   period.
2. Their activity patterns were inconsistent with typical open source
   contributors, suggesting potential misuse of accounts or automation.

Defected can help identify such patterns in contributors' Git activity.

### Detecting JiaT75's Behavior with Defected

Suppose you have a repository of **xz** and suspect malicious activity. You
can use **Defected** to analyze the commit logs for anomalies.

Let's analyze the xz repository:
```bash
defected analyze --repo https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz --only-suspicious
```

This command output something like the following:
```
$ defected analyze --repo https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz --only-suspicious
Cloning remote repository: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz...
Extracting Git logs...
2676 commits extracted.
Parsing logs...
Analyzing timezones with a threshold of 2 timezone changes...

Showing only suspicious results:
             author  total_commits  unique_timezones  timezone_changes  suspicious                     email
36     Lasse Collin           2102                 3                36        True  lasse.collin@tukaani.org
28          Jia Tan            449                 3                14        True        jiat0218@gmail.com
32  Jonathan Nieder              9                 3                 4        True        jrnieder@gmail.com

Saving analysis to 'timezone_analysis.csv'...
Analysis saved.
```

Results are exported at the CSV format and can be loaded in sheet:

| author          | total_commits | unique_timezones  | timezone_changes | suspicious | email                     |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Lasse Collin    | 2102          | 3                 | 36               | True       | lasse.collin@tukaani.org  |
| Jia Tan         | 449           | 3                 | 14               | True       | jiat0218@gmail.com        |
| Jonathan Nieder | 9             | 3                 | 4                | True       | jrnieder@gmail.com        |

If we continue our investigation with the `inspect` command, we can found
more useful details:

```
$ defected inspect --repo https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz --user "Jia Tan"
Commits found for Jia Tan: 450

Timezone usage:
  timezone  commit_count
0    +0800           441
1    +0300             6
2    +0200             3

From +0200 at 2022-11-07 16:24:14 to +0800 at 2022-11-19 23:18:04
From +0800 at 2023-06-20 20:32:59 to +0300 at 2023-06-27 17:27:09
From +0300 at 2023-06-27 17:27:09 to +0800 at 2023-06-27 23:38:32
From +0800 at 2024-02-09 23:59:54 to +0200 at 2024-02-12 17:09:10
From +0200 at 2024-02-12 17:09:10 to +0800 at 2024-02-13 01:53:33
```

We can clearly observe that "Jia Tan" traveled at the speed of the light:
```
From +0300 at 2023-06-27 17:27:09 to +0800 at 2023-06-27 23:38:32
```

Moving from Eastern Europe to Asia in a snap of the fingers.


### Interpretation

The results show that **Jia Tan** also known as **[JiaT75](https://github.com/JiaT75)**:
- Contributed 449 commits to the repository.
- Operated from **3 different timezones** during his activity period.
- Exhibited **14 timezone changes**, exceeding the threshold of 2, which flags them as "suspicious."

These irregular patterns warrant further investigation and could have raised
red flags before the backdoor was merged.

Obviously not all activities are not suspicious. The result above also show
legit activity like the ones from Lasse and Jonathan. But the one from Jia
as been proven to be security attack lead through social engineering.

### Lessons Learned

This case highlights the importance of monitoring contributor activity,
especially in critical open source projects.

By using tools like Defected, maintainers can:
1. Proactively identify suspicious contributors.
2. Investigate anomalies in commit patterns.
3. Prevent security risks, such as backdoors, before they impact end users.

### Why This Matters

The case of **JiaT75** is a reminder that even trusted repositories can be
compromised. Open source maintainers need tools like Defected to protect their
projects from potential threats by identifying early warning signs such as
irregular timezone changes.

Obviously, not all timezone changes are suspicious, many of them are legit,
but like demonstrated by xz example some are real attempts. **JiaT75** tried
to show that he was located in Asia where some timezone changes reflect
western Europe timezone. Some timezone changes are so short that **JiaT75**
travel faster than light.

**We should notice that it is now easy to understand the whole story after the
fact. We don't want to incriminate anyone. We simply want to highligh such
kind of social engineering to try to avoid in the future.**

## How It Works

1. **Log Extraction**:
   - Extracts contributor metadata (author, email, date, timezone) using Git.
2. **Analysis**:
   - Groups commits by contributors.
   - Detects timezone changes and flags irregular patterns.
3. **Results**:
   - Outputs analysis to the terminal.
   - Exports results to a CSV file.

## Future Improvements

- **Holiday Detection**:
  - Cross-reference commit dates with public holiday calendars for anomaly
    detection.
- **Commit Pattern Visualization**:
  - Add heatmaps or graphs to visualize contributors' activity.
- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Automate detection in pipelines to secure projects during updates.
