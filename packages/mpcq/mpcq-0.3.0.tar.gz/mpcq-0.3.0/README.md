This is a client library for interacting with an MPC observations database.

## Notice

The Asteroid Institute hosts a private mirror of the Minor Planet Center's Small Bodies Node.

To set up your own mirror, please see the [SBN guidelines](https://sbnwiki.astro.umd.edu/wiki/). While support is planned for connecting to an arbitrary database mirror, the current version of this package only supports connecting to a hosted Cloud SQL instance on GCP.

Two indices on the observation table have been added for performance reasons. They are listed below with their sql definitions:
- obs_sbn_submission_id
```sql
CREATE INDEX obs_sbn_submission_id ON public.obs_sbn USING hash (submission_id);
```
- obs_sbn_provid
```sql
CREATE INDEX obs_sbn_provid ON public.obs_sbn USING hash (provid)
```

## Usage

To connect to the Asteroid Institute's clone of the Small Bodies Node MPC database:
```python
from mpcq.client import MPCObservationsClient

client = MPCObservationsClient.connect_using_gcloud()
```

With a client initialized, you can get all observations of a particular object using its provisional designation:
```python
observations = client.get_object_observations("2013 RR165")
observations = list(observations)
```

These can be converted into a dataframe as follows:

```python
from mpcq.utils import observations_to_dataframe

observations_df = observations_to_dataframe(observations)
print(observations_df.head(5))
```
```

Getting the submission ID and the number of observations per submission of an object:
```python
submissions = client.get_object_submissions("2013 RR165")
submissions = list(submissions)
```

As before, these can be converted to a dataframe:
```python
from mpcq.utils import submissions_to_dataframe

submissions_df = submissions_to_dataframe(submissions)
print(submissions_df)
```
```
