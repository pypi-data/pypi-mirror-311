CMLibs Exporter
===============

CMLibs exporter classes.  This software can be found on PyPi and installed with the following command::

  pip install cmlibs.exporter

When using the thumbnail exporter there are additional requirements for hardware or software rendering.
To install the thumbnail exporter with support for hardware rendering install *cmlibs.exporter* with::

  pip install 'cmlibs.exporter[thumbnail_hardware]'

To install the thumbnail exporter with support for software rendering install *cmlibs.exporter* with::

  pip install 'cmlibs.exporter[thumbnail_software]'

To force the use of the software renderer even when hardware rendering is available, set an environment variable like so::

  OC_EXPORTER_RENDERER=osmesa

either in the environment the exporter is run in or before calling the export thumbnail method.
