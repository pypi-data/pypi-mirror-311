# Bikeability

"Bikeability" is a Python package to automatically compute bike-friendliness of specific areas.
With this library, users can download [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM)
 data and generate spatial indicators for bikeability (bike facilities on main streets, green share, share of secondary 
and tertiary roads, node density and bike shop density). Based on these indicators, it is possible to calculate a bikeability index 
([Hardinghaus et al. 2021](https://elib.dlr.de/144713/)) using a weighting approach derived from an expert survey.


# Installation and Usage

Please see the [user guide](https://bikeability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
for information about installation and usage.

# Examples

To get started with bikeability, read the user reference and see the sample code and input data in the [examples repository](https://github.com/DLR-VF/bikeability-examples).

# Features

Bikeability is built on top of osmnx, geopandas, networkx.

* Download and prepare road networks and additional data from OpenStreetMap 
* Calculate indicators to derive bike-friendliness of certain regions
* Weight the indicators and generate a bikeability index
