    USD Search and Asset Graph Search APIs

    # USD Search API Overview **USD Search** is a versatile AI-powered search engine designed to enable comprehensive searches across images (e.g., .jpg, .png) and USD-based 3D models within various storage backends (AWS S3 and Omniverse Nucleus server). It enables users to use natural language, image similarity, and precise metadata criteria (file name, type, date, size, creator, etc.) to locate relevant content efficiently. Furthermore, when integrated with the Asset Graph Search, USD Search extends its capabilities to include searches based on USD properties and spatial dimensions of 3D model bounding boxes, enhancing the ability to find assets that meet specific requirements. ## Features - **Natural Language Searches:** - Utilize AI to search for images and USD-based 3D models using simple, descriptive language. - **Image Similarity Searches:** - Find images similar to a reference image through AI-driven image comparisons. - **Metadata Filtering:** - Filter search results by file name, file type, creation/modification dates, file size, and creator/modifier metadata. - **USD Content Filtering with Asset Graph Search:** - When used with the Asset Graph Search, search capabilities are expanded to include filtering based on USD properties and object dimensions. - **Multiple Storage Backend Support:** - Compatible with various storage backends, including AWS S3 buckets and Omniverse Nucleus server. - **Advanced File Name, Extension, and Path Filters:** - Use wildcards for broad or specific file name and extension searches. - **Date and Size Range Filtering:** - Specify assets created or modified within certain date ranges or file sizes larger or smaller than a designated threshold. - **User-based Filtering:** - Filter assets based on their creator or modifier, allowing for searches tailored to particular users' contributions. - **Embedding-based Similarity Threshold:** - Set a similarity threshold for more nuanced control over search results in embedding-based searches. - **Custom Search Paths and Scenes:** - Specify search locations within the storage backend or conduct searches within specific scenes for targeted results. - **Return Detailed Results:** - Option to include images, metadata, root prims, and predictions in the search results.  # Asset Graph Search (AGS) API Overview **Asset Graph Search (AGS)** provides advanced querying capabilities for assets and USD trees indexed in a graph database. It supports proximity queries based on coordinates or prims to find objects within specified areas or radii, sorted by distance, and includes transformation options for vector alignment. The API also offers dependency and reverse dependency searches, helping to identify all assets referenced in a scene or scenes containing a particular asset, which can optimize scene loading and track dependency changes. By combining different query types, the AGS API enables complex scenarios for scene understanding, manipulation, and generation. Integrated with USD Search it provides in-scene search functionality. ## Features - **Proximity Queries:** - Find objects within a specified bounding box or radius. - Results sorted by distance with options for vector alignment using a transformation matrix. - **USD Property Queries:** - Enables querying objects in a 3D scene using USD properties, such as finding all assets with a specific semantic label. - **Asset Dependency Searches:** - Identify all assets referenced in a scene â€” including USD references, material references, or textures. - Reverse search to find all scenes containing a particular asset. - **Combined Query Capabilities:** - Enable complex scenarios for enhanced scene understanding, manipulation, and generation. - **Integration with USD Search:** - Provides in-scene search functionality.
