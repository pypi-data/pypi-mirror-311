Here is the list of the QnA's

Question 1: Can my sister join me?

Answer 3: For insurance X, the coverage will be up to 300€. This also includes all costs related to post-operational complications.

Question 4: Where can I park?
Answer 4: Cataract surgery is done at the day clinic, so it's best to park at P3, left of the main entrance. From there, you can follow route 344.

Question 5: What is cataract surgery?
Answer 5: Cataract surgery is a procedure to remove the cloudy lens of your eye and replace it with an artificial lens to restore clear vision.

Question 6: How is cataract surgery performed?
Answer 6: The surgery involves making a small incision in your eye, breaking up the cloudy lens, removing it, and inserting an artificial intraocular lens (IOL).

Question 7: Is cataract surgery painful?
Answer 7: Cataract surgery is generally not painful. Local anesthesia is used to numb the eye, and most patients only feel mild pressure during the procedure.

Question 8: How long does cataract surgery take?
Answer 8: The surgery typically takes about 15 to 30 minutes, but you should plan for a few hours at the clinic for preparation and recovery.

Question 9: Will I be awake during the surgery?
Answer 9: Yes, you will be awake, but your eye will be numbed with anesthesia, and you may be given a sedative to help you relax.

Question 10: What are the risks of cataract surgery?
Answer 10: Cataract surgery is generally safe, but risks include infection, bleeding, retinal detachment, and complications from anesthesia.

Question 11: What is an intraocular lens (IOL)?
Answer 11: An IOL is an artificial lens implanted in your eye during cataract surgery to replace the cloudy natural lens.

Question 12: What types of IOLs are available?
Answer 12: There are monofocal, multifocal, and toric IOLs. Monofocal lenses provide clear vision at one distance, multifocal lenses correct vision at multiple distances, and toric lenses correct astigmatism.

Question 13: Which type of IOL is best for me?
Answer 13: Your ophthalmologist will help determine the best IOL based on your vision needs, lifestyle, and any pre-existing eye conditions.

Question 14: Will cataract surgery correct my vision?
Answer 14: Cataract surgery usually improves vision, but you may still need glasses or contact lenses for certain tasks, depending on the type of IOL chosen.
