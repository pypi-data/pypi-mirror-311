# **YoungerSibling**

## **Overview**
YoungerSibling is a Python-based terminal utility script designed for educational purposes. It provides a set of useful tools to perform tasks like searching the web, performing lookups (Google search, IP lookup, username lookup, etc.), and extracting metadata from images, directly from the terminal. This project aims to help students, developers, and hobbyists learn about web scraping, API usage, and terminal interaction with Python.
