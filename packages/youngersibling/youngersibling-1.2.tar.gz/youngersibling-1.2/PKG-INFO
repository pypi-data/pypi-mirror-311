## **Overview**
YoungerSibling is a Python-based terminal utility script designed for educational purposes. It provides a set of useful tools to perform tasks like searching the web, performing lookups (Google search, IP lookup, username lookup, etc.), and extracting metadata from images, directly from the terminal. This project aims to help students, developers, and hobbyists learn about web scraping, API usage, and terminal interaction with Python.

## **Features**
- **Enhanced Google Search**: Perform web searches from the terminal with more accuracy and updated
- **IP Lookup**: Get geolocation information about an IP address.
- **Username Lookup**: Check if a username exists across 400+ social media platforms, faster and more accurate than any other tool to ever exist.
- **Email Lookup**: Get Mail Exchange (MX) records for an email domain.
- **Exif Data Extraction**: Extract and display EXIF metadata from image files.
- **Phone Lookup**: Retrieve detailed information about a phone number, including location and
- **Web OSINT**: Perform Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) operations to gather information from publicly available sources on the web

## **New Features**
### **Enhanced Google Search**
The Google Search feature is now enhanced to provide more accurate and relevant results. It leverages updated algorithms and APIs to fetch the most current data, ensuring that users get precise and reliable search outcomes. 
 ### **Phone Lookup**
This new feature allows users to input a phone number and retrieve detailed information, including the location, carrier, and other pertinent data, directly from the terminal. 
### **Web OSINT**
The Web OSINT feature is designed to perform comprehensive Open Source Intelligence operations. It gathers and analyzes information from publicly available sources on the web, making it a powerful tool for research and investigative purposes
## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: The main programming language used to create the script.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests for data fetching.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping (specifically Google search results).
- **DNS Resolver**: For querying MX records of email domains.
- **ExifRead**: For extracting EXIF metadata from image files.
- **TerminalTables**: To display results in a neat, readable table format.
- **Colorama**: For colorizing terminal output for better readability.
- **TQDM**: For showing progress bars during operations to enhance the user experience
- **python-whois**: For performing WHOIS lookups to retrieve domain registration information.
- **datetime**: For handling date and time operations within the script.
- **libphonenumbers**: For retrieving informations of the Phone Number.
