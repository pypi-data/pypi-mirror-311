    Estimate transmission as the ratio of modeled effective irradiance to
    measured irradiance.

    Measured irradiance should be in the array's plane and represent snow-free
    conditions. For example, the measured irradiance could be obtained with a
    heated plane-of-array pyranometer. When necessary, the irradiance should be
    adjusted for reflections and spectral content.

    Parameters
    ----------

        site conditions. [unitless]
    threshold_transmission : float

    vmp_ratio : array-like
        Ratio between measured DC voltage and DC voltage modeled with
        calculated transmission.

    Notes
    -----
    Modes are defined in [1]_:

    * Mode 0: Indicates periods with enough opaque snow that the system is not
      producing power. Specifically, Mode 0 is when the measured voltage is
      below the lower bound of the inverter's MPPT range but the voltage
      modeled using measured irradiance and ideal transmission is above the
      lower bound of the inverter's MPPT range.
    * Mode 1: Indicates periods when the system has non-uniform snow which
      affects all strings. Mode 1 is assigned when both operating voltage and
      current are reduced. Operating voltage is reduced when snow causes
      mismatch and current is decreased due to reduced transmission.
    * Mode 2: Indicates periods when the system has non-uniform snow which
      causes mismatch for some modules, but doesn't reduce light transmission
      to other modules.
    * Mode 3: Indicates periods when the the system has snow that reduces
      light transmission but doesn't create mismatch. Operating voltage is
      consistent with snow-free conditions but current is reduced.
    * Mode 4: Voltage and current are consistent with snow-free conditions.

    * Mode -1: Indicates periods where it is unknown if or how snow impacts
      power output. Mode -1 includes periods when:

          1. Voltage modeled using measured irradiance and ideal transmission
             is outside the inverter's MPPT range, OR
          2. measured voltage exceeds the upper bound of the inverter's MPPT
             algorithm.

      Mode -1 is added in this function to cover a case that was not addressed
      in [1]_.

    Mode is None when measured values (voltage, current, irradiance or
    temperature) are either missing or produce modeled voltage that is
    invalid.
