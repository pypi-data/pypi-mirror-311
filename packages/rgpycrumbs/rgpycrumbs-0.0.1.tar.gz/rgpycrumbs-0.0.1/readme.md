[![Hatch project](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A5%9A-Hatch-4051b5.svg)](https://github.com/pypa/hatch)

A **pure-python** module of helpful scripts / CLIs I have written mostly for quick
and dirty parsing / plotting of optimization methods. Loosely grouped. Not
optimal at all.

Most of these rely heavily on optional dependencies, with the exception of the
`_aux` helpers (pure Python).
