This is an msilib replacement for Python versions 3.13.0+
=========================================================

Usage
-----
This library can be import as either msilib or pymsilib.

General
-------
MSILib is a python library for creating and manipulating MSI files.
This is legacy code. If you are creating a new project, I strongly suggest 
you do not use MSIs. 

Release Information
-------------------
MSILib has been deprecated for quite a while and as of Python 3.13.0, msilib 
is no longer included in the build.  This library takes the existing msilib 
code and packages it as an extra module.
The original code can be found in the Python Git repository (links below).
It is replicated here with minimal changes.
