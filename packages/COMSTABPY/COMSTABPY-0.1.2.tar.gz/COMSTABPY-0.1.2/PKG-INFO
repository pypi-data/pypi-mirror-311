COMSTABPY is an python package that contains basic functions to apply the unified framework for partitioning the drivers of stability of ecological communities developed in (Segrestin et al. 2024 Global Ecology and Biogeography, 10.1111/geb.13828). Additionally it provides some plotting function. The code is partially based on the original R package comstab, url: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/comstab/index.html 

## INSTALLING
COMSTABPY can be installed via the command line using

`pip install COMSTABPY`

If you are using conda you can install the enivronment *environmentl.yaml*, which contains also other packages usefull for data analysis.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml`
conda activate stab-py
```
## USAGE
Basic examples of package uses are shows in the jupytern notebook [docs/example.ipynb](https://github.com/gocchipintive/COMSTABPY/blob/main/docs/example.ipynb)

> ** IMPORTANT ** If arrays or lists have to be provided to package functions please use numpy arrays
