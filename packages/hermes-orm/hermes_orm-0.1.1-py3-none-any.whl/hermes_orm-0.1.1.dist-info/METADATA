- **Dynamic Model Mapping**: Automatically map Python classes to database tables with field validation and relational support.
- **Advanced Query Builder**: Intuitive querying with dynamic `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
- **Rich Relationships**: Support for `One-to-One`, `One-to-Many`, `Many-to-Many`, and polymorphic `Morph` relationships.
- **Migrations Manager**: Create, apply, and rollback migrations seamlessly.
- **Asynchronous & Synchronous Database Operations**: Flexible execution modes to match your application’s needs.
- **Caching Mechanisms**: Built-in query caching for optimized performance.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Hermes ORM

Install Hermes ORM via pip:

```bash
pip install hermes-orm
```

### Step 2: Define Your Models

Define models that represent your database structure:

```python
from hermes.model import BaseModel
from hermes.fields import IntegerField, StringField, ForeignKeyField

class User(BaseModel):
    id = IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    name = StringField(max_length=255, nullable=False)

class Post(BaseModel):
    id = IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    user_id = ForeignKeyField("User", nullable=False)
    content = StringField(nullable=False)
```

### Step 3: Run Migrations

Use the CLI to generate and apply migrations:

```bash
hermes make_migration create_users_table create
hermes migrate
```

### Step 4: Query the Database

Perform operations on your models:

```python
# Create a user
user = User(name="Alice")
user.save(db_connection)

# Fetch all posts
posts = Post.all(db_connection)

# Add a post for a user
post = Post(user_id=user.id, content="Hello, Hermes!")
post.save(db_connection)
```

## 🧩 Supported Relationships

- **One-to-One**: Easily map one-to-one relationships with `OneToOne` fields.
- **One-to-Many**: Establish hierarchical relationships with `OneToMany`.
- **Many-to-Many**: Simplify complex mappings with `ManyToMany` pivot tables.
- **Polymorphic**: Use `MorphOne` and `MorphMany` for flexible, type-based relations.

Each relationship is implemented with robust utilities for querying and manipulation.
