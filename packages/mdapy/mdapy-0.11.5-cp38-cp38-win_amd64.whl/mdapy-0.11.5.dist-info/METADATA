*mdapy* : Molecular Dynamics Analysis with Python
=====================================================

Overview
---------

The **mdapy** python library provides an array of powerful, flexible, and straightforward 
tools to analyze atomic trajectories generated from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The library is fully 
cross-platform, making it accessible to users in **Windows, Linux, and Mac OS**. 
Benefited by the `TaiChi <https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi>`_ project, 
we can effectively accelerate the pure python code, bringing it closer to the speed of code written in C++. 
Furthermore, **mdapy** is highly parallelized, allowing users to leverage the resources of both multicore CPU and GPU. 
**mdapy** can directly handle the DUMP and DATA formats in `LAMMPS <https://www.lammps.org/>`_, POSCAR format in `VASP <https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/The_VASP_Manual>`_, 
universal XYZ format and CIF format. Besides, all data in **mdapy** is stored in NDARRAY format in `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_, which enables easy integration 
with the scientific ecosystem in python and facilitates collaboration with other post-progressing 
tools such as `OVITO <https://www.ovito.org/>`_ and `freud <https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud>`_.
