# RefIdxDB

Python interface for various refractive index databases

I was tired to download files from here and there, parse them each manually and locally.
Hence, I copied most of my parsing code into this project, so it can be developed further.

> [!note]
> If your source is not implemented, feel free to open an issue!
> You can also try to implement it yourself.
> You can take `refidx` and `aria` as a reference on what needs to be implemented.

## Installation

`refidxdb` can be downloaded from PiPy.org:

```sh
pip install refidxdb
```

After the `pip` command, the `refidxdb` command should be available.
The main purpose of this command is to download and cache the databases locally.
They will be downloaded to `$HOME/.cache/refidxdb` under a folder corresponding to the class name.

## API

`RefIdxDB`: is the main blueprint class from which all the specific parser classes need to inherit.
This yields a unified API, i.e., all the instances have the same methods available.

`path`: is the path leading to the wanted file relative to the database.
This value can be usually copied from the URL.

`data`: represents the raw data obtained from the file found under `path`.

`nk`: are the parsed real and imaginary parts of the refractive index.
The main column is always the wavelength, i.e., wave numbers will always be transformed into wavelengths.

`interpolate`: you rarely want to use the tables as is, therefore an interpolation method is implemented
to calculate `n` and `k` for a target wavelength.

> [!warning]
> Only wavelengths are currently supported, since they are my main use-case.
> If you have a proposal on how to add wave number support, please submit an issue/PR.

## Supported DBs

### [refractiveindex.info](https://refractiveindex.info/)

`refractiveindex.info` mainly differentiates between raw data with wavelengths in micrometers,
or polynomial functions which hold for a certain range. The raw data is contained in `YAML` files,
with each data type being referenced.

Currently, supported data types are:

- `tabulated_nk`

### [ARIA - Aerosol Refractive Index Archive](https://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/ARIA/)

Aria consists of `ri` files, which are whitespace separated values.
The header is prefixed by a hashtag `#`. The `FORMAT` value gives information about the column labels.
Both wavelengths `WAVL` and wave numbers `WAVN` will be read correctly and transformed into wavelengths
with no SI prefix (meters [m]). The default scales for wavelengths and wave numbers are 1e-6 (micrometers)
and 1e2 (centimeters^-1).
