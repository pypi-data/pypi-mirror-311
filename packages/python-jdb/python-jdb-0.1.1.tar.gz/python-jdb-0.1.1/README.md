# python-jdb
A json based database library, RAM running and including basic read-write lock.

# What is jdb?
`jdb` means json based database, but with some fixed structure.

## database & table
python-jdb made its own file format, `.jdb`.

A `.jdb` file's data is a database(db) itself. Its each key is a table(tb) name, and the value is a table data.

Seems like this:
```json
// db1.jdb
{
    "tb1": {...},
    "tb2": {...}
}
```

## table data
As said above, the value of each key of jdb is a table data. A table data is a json format data too, with two fixed keys: `columns` and `rows`.

The value of `columns` is a list of columns' infos, and the value of `rows` is a list of rows' datas.

Seems like this:
```json
// db1.jdb
{
    "tb1": {
        "columns": [...],
        "rows": [...],
    },
    "tb2": {
        "columns": [...],
        "rows": [...],
    }
}
```

For understanding better, let's see `rows` structure first.

### rows
`rows` is a list of row data, it is a list of dict. And each row data is a dict, with attribute name as key, and attribute value as value. You can think a row data is descrbibing like: A person with name "Alice", age 18.

So rows datas seems like this:
```json
...
    "rows": [
        {"id": "32132654", "name": "Alice", "age": 18, ...},
        {"id": "65653251", "name": "Jerry", "age": 19, ...},
        ...
    ],
...
```
Each attribute name would have a corresponding column info in `columns`. As you can see below.

### columns
`columns` is a list of column infos, it is a list of dict too. Each column info is a dict, with column's info name as key, and column's info value as value.

There are two fixed info names are fixed.
- `name`: the name of the column.
- `rname`: the readable name of the column.

And any other info names are custom info names, you can define them by yourself. The python-jdb library would make sure that every row data attribute name is in the `columns` list.

Seems like this:
```json
...
    "columns": [
        {"name": "id", "rname": "ID", ...},
        {"name": "name", "rname": "Person's name", ...},
        {"name": "age", "rname": "Person's age", ...},
    ],
...
```

# How to use
This `python-jdb` library helps handle `.jdb` file, and it provides some functions to operate the database.

## install & import
You can install it by pip:
```
pip install python-jdb
```
And import it:
```python
from python-jdb import jdb_handler
```

## Lock & Unlock
In order to avoid data corruption for multi-threaded, multi-processed environment, `python-jdb` provides read-write lock directly. It means when you used(read or write) one jdb file, the file would be locked up.
To make the api more readable, the function is named `use` and `un_use`.

### use & un_use
`use` function is used to lock the jdb file, and `un_use` function is used to unuse the jdb file.

```python
# lock the jdb file
jdb_handler.use("db1.jdb")

# unlock the jdb file
jdb_handler.un_use("db1.jdb")
```

When you use a jdb, you should make sure that you unlock it after you finish using it. Otherwise next time you use the same jdb, it would be block for five seconds and print a warning.

## Query Datas
As it is a json format with fixed structure, you can use `json` library to get datas directly. But `python-jdb` provides some functions to make it more readable.

### get_tb_data
`get_tb_data` function is used to get the table data of a table.

```python
tb_data = jdb_handler.get_tb_data("db1", "tb1")
```

### query_rows
`query_row` function is used to query the rows that with some conditions. For now, it searches rows by `col_name` and `col_value` provided.

```python
rows = jdb_handler.query_rows("db1", "tb1", "name", "Alice")
```
This would return a list of row data dict that with `name` attribute value is "Alice".

## Write Datas
As it is a json format with fixed structure, you can use `json` library to write datas directly. But `python-jdb` provides some functions to make it more readable.

### add_rows
`add_rows` function is used to add rows to a table. And it has upsert mode. Which would just update the row if it exists, or add the row if it doesn't exist.

```python
row_datas = [
    {"id": "32132654", "name": "Alice", "age": 18, ...},
    {"id": "65653251", "name": "Jerry", "age": 19, ...},
    ...
]
jdb_handler.add_rows("db1", "tb1", row_datas, "name", upsert_mode=True)
```

This would add the rows to `tb1` table in `db1` database. If the row with `name` attribute value is "Alice" exists, it would be updated. Otherwise it would be added.

## One-time functions
As said above, normally you need to `use` a jdb and do something with it, then you need to `un_use` it. It is for fast RAM running when you need to do many operations to one jdb. But for some one time operation like "reading the table and do nothing else", the use-do-un_use steps are a little bit annoying. So `python-jdb` provides some one-time functions to make it more convenient.

Here're some one-time functions like:
- `get_tb_data_once`
- `query_rows_once`
- `add_rows_once`

They are the same as the normal functions, but you don't need to `use` and `un_use` the jdb yourself, the function would do it for you.
