    r"""Abstract class for recreating from average (RFA) a function `y` measured in `x`.

    To perform recreate from average, call `rfa()` method, which returns newly created
    points.

    By default, `x` axis is oversampled with `n` linearly space values between each
    point. To change this behaviour, override `_initial_x_oversample` method.

    By default, `y` axis is oversampled with `n` piecewise constant values between each
    point. To change this behaviour, override `_initial_y_oversample` method.

    The `rfa()` method returns recreated function values for x and y.

    In the following derived classes, term 'interval' refers to the distance
    between two consecutive observations (values in `y` based on `x`).
    Each interval contains `n` samples obtained by oversampling.

    .. image:: /_static/gfx/apidocs/linear_fixed_rfa.png

    Transition linearly between intervals in transition window (part of the interval).
    Transition window is defined in number of samples `a` and divided proportionally
    to the left and right side of the interval. If `a` is not specified, it is obtained
    based on the transition samples factor `alpha` multiplied by the number of inserted
    samples for each interval `n`. `a` cannot be lower, than 2 samples. If it is,
    it's value is changed to correct that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: 1-D array-like
        Independent variable in strictly increasing order.
    y: 1-D array-like
        Dependent variable.
    n: int
        Number of points oversampled and recreated in the function.
    alpha: float, default: 1.0
        Transition window samples factor for moving between intervals.
    a: int, optional
        Transition window samples for moving between intervals.
        If not specified, it is equal to `alpha` * `n`. Cannot be lower than 2.

    Notes
    -----
    Let us consider `k`-th interval and :math:`x_{k,i}`, :math:`y{k,i}`
    refer to `i`-th sample of `k`-th interval for `x` and `y`, respectively.
    When omitting value, e.g., :math:`x_{k}`, it refers to the `x_{k,0}`.

    Oversampling creates function :math:`z = g(x)` from :math:`y=f(x)`.

    Let assume, that:

    * the function is going to be oversampled with `n` samples in each interval.
    * :math:`\alpha` is a given transition window factor parameter.
    * :math:`z_{k}` is transition value between interval `k` and `k - 1`.
    * :math:`z_{k+1}` is transition value between interval `k` and `k + 1`.
    * :math:`y_{k}` is original function value in interval `k`.

    Left :math:`a_l` and right :math:`a_r` transition number of samples is calculated
    as:

    .. math::
        a = \alpha \cdot n \\
        a_l = a_r = a / 2

    :math:`z_k` is calculated as a linear combination between :math:`y_{k-1}` and `y_k`,
    proportionally to the distance between the :math:`x_{k-1,n-a_l}` and :math:`x_{k,
    a_r}`, i.e.,

    .. math::
        z_k = y_{k-1} + (y_k - y_{k-1}) \cdot (x_k - x_{k-1, n - a_r}) /
        (x_{k, a_l} - x_{k-1, n - a_r})

    Value for :math:`z_{k+1}` is calculated analogously.

    Based on found transition values, remaining points in function :math:`z = g(x)`
    are calculated as a linear combination of transition point and previous value.

    .. math::
        \begin{cases}
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, 0}, z_{k, 0}), (x_{k, a_l},
            y_{k, 0})) &   i \in \{0, a_l - 1\} \\
            z_{k,i} = y_{k,i} & i \in \{a_l, n - a_r\} \\
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, n - a_r}, y_{k,0}),
            (x_{k, n}, z_{k+1,0})) &  i \in \{n - a_r + 1, n\}
        \end{cases}

class LinearAdaptiveRFA(AbstractRFA):
    r"""Linearly moves between points in adaptive transition intervals.

    .. image:: /_static/gfx/apidocs/linear_adaptive_rfa.png

    Transition linearly between intervals in transition window (part of the interval).
    Transition window is defined in number of samples `a` and divided according to the
    `adaptive_factor`. `adaptive_factor` is inversely proportionally to the change of
    function value on both edges of the interval, i.e., if function value has higher
    change on the right side of the interval, than on the left side, the right side
    transition window is smaller than the left one.

    The impact of the `adaptive_factor` can be decreased by adjusting `adaptive_smooth`.

    If `a` is not specified, it is obtained based on the transition samples factor
    `alpha` multiplied by the number of inserted samples for each interval `n`.
    `a` cannot be lower, than 2 samples. If it is, it's value is changed to correct
    that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: 1-D array-like
        Independent variable in strictly increasing order.
    y: 1-D array-like
        Dependent variable.
    n: int
        Number of points oversampled and recreated in the function.
    alpha: float, default: 1.0
        Transition window samples factor for moving between intervals.
    a: int, optional
        Transition window samples for moving between intervals.
        If not specified, it is equal to `alpha` * `n`. Cannot be lower than 2.
    adaptive_smooth: float, default: 1.0
        Decreasing impact of `adaptive_factor` by raising it to the power
        `1/adaptive_smooth`.


    Notes
    -----
    Let us consider `k`-th interval and :math:`x_{k,i}`, :math:`y{k,i}`
    refer to `i`-th sample of `k`-th interval for `x` and `y`, respectively.
    When omitting value, e.g., :math:`x_{k}`, it refers to the `x_{k,0}`.

    Oversampling creates function :math:`z = g(x)` from :math:`y=f(x)`.

    Let assume, that:

    * the function is going to be oversampled with `n` samples in each interval.
    * :math:`\alpha` is a given transition window factor parameter.
    * :math:`s` is a given `adaptive_smooth` parameter
    * :math:`z_{k}` is transition value between interval `k` and `k - 1`.
    * :math:`z_{k+1}` is transition value between interval `k` and `k + 1`.
    * :math:`y_{k}` is original function value in interval `k`.

    Transition ranges depend on the change in function value between intervals.

    1. When function changes between intervals, i.e., :math:`y_{k-1} \neq y_k \neq
    y_{k+1}`,
    an `adaptive_factor` :math:`\gamma_k` and left and right transition windows
    :math:`a_k,l` and :math:`a_k,r` are calculated, as:

    .. math::
        \gamma_k = \frac{|y_{1} - y_{0}|}{|y_{0} - y_{-1}|} ^ \frac{1/s} \\
        \frac{a_{k,l}}{a_{k,r}} = \gamma_k \\
        a_{k,l} = \min(\max(\frac{\gamma_k \cdot a}{1 + \gamma_k}, 1), a) \\
        a_{k,r} = \min(\max(\frac{a}{1 + \gamma_k}, 1), a)

    The transition values are kept between `1` and `n`, thus:

    .. math::
        a_{k,l} = \min(\max(a_{k,l}, 1) n) \\
        a_{k,r} = \min(\max(a_{k,r}, 1) n) \\

    2. If function value is left and right side constant, i.e.,  :math:`y_{k-1} = y_k
    = y_{k+1}`,
    transition windows are calculated as:

    .. math::
        a_{k, l} = a_{k, r} = 0

    3. If function value is changing only on right side of the interval, i.e.,
    :math:`y_{k-1} \neq y_k = y_{k+1}`,

    .. math::
        a_{k, l} = 0
        a_{k, r} = \frac{a}{2}

    4. If function value is changing only on left side of the interval, i.e.,
    :math:`y_{k-1} = y_k \neq y_{k+1}`,

    .. math::
        a_{k, l} = \frac{a}{2}
        a_{k, r} = 0

    Transition points and remaining points inside the interval are calculated same as
    in :func:`LinearFixedOversample`.

    .. math::
        \begin{cases}
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, 0}, z_{k, 0}), (x_{k, a_{k,
            l}}, y_{k, 0})) &   i \in \{0, a_l - 1\} \\
            z_{k,i} = y_{k,i} & i \in \{a_{k,l}, n - a_r\} \\
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, n - a_{k, r}}, y_{k, 0}),
            (x_{k, n}, z_{k+1,0}))
            &  i \in \{n - a_{k,r} + 1, n\}

    transition window (part of the interval).
    Transition window is defined in number of samples `a` and divided proportionally
    to the left and right side of the interval.
    If `a` is not specified, it is obtained based on the transition samples factor
    `alpha` multiplied by the number of inserted samples for each interval `n`.
    `a` cannot be lower, than 2 samples. If it is, it's value is changed to correct
    that.

    Left and right transition window is further divided into linear only part and
    combination of
    linear and exponential one. Division is done according to parameter `beta` and
    linear transition window is calculated as `b = beta * a_l`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: 1-D array-like
        Independent variable in strictly increasing order.
    y: 1-D array-like
        Dependent variable.

        Number of points oversampled and recreated in the function.
    alpha: float, default: 1.0
        Transition window samples factor for moving between intervals.
    beta: float, default: 0.5
        Linear transition window samples factor.
    a: int, optional
        Transition window samples for moving between intervals.
        If not specified, it is equal to `alpha` * `n`. Cannot be lower than 2.
    exp: float, default: 2.0
        Exponent in exponential transition function.

    Notes
    -----
    Let us consider `k`-th interval and :math:`x_{k,i}`, :math:`y{k,i}`
    refer to `i`-th sample of `k`-th interval for `x` and `y`, respectively.
    When omitting value, e.g., :math:`x_{k}`, it refers to the `x_{k,0}`.

    Oversampling creates function :math:`z = g(x)` from :math:`y=f(x)`.

    Let assume, that:
    * the function is going to be oversampled with `n` samples in each interval.
    * :math:`\alpha` is a given transition window factor parameter.
    * :math:`\beta` is a given linear part of transition window factor parameter.
    * :math:`z_{k}` is transition value between interval `k` and `k - 1`.
    * :math:`z_{k+1}` is transition value between interval `k` and `k + 1`.
    * :math:`y_{k}` is original function value in interval `k`.

    Left :math:`a_l` and right :math:`a_r` transition number of samples is calculated
    as:

    .. math::
        a = \alpha \cdot n \\
        a_l = a_r = a / 2

    Let :math:`b` denote  Linear part of transition window, and it is calculated as:

    .. math::
        b = \beta \cdot a_l

    Transition points are calculated the same as in :func:`LinearFixedOversample`.

    Based on found transition values, remaining points in function :math:`z = g(x)`
    are calculated
    as a linear combination of transition point and previous value using linear and
    exponential functions.

    Two additional transition points are calculated, corresponding to :math:`x_{k,
    b}` and :math:`x_{k, n - b}`
    denoted as `z_{k, b}` and `z_{k, n-b}`. They are calculated as linear combination
    between
    :math:`z_{k, 0}` and :math:`y_{k, 0}`, and :math:`z_{k+1, 0}` and :math:`y_{k,
    0}`, respectively.


    .. math::
        \begin{cases}
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, 0}, z_{k, 0}), (x_{k, b},
            z_{k, b})) &   i \in \{0, b - 1\} \\
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_exp_xy_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, b}, z_{k, b}), (x_{k,
            a_l}, y_{k, 0})) &   i \in \{b, a_l - 1\} \\
            z_{k,i} = y_{k,i} & i \in \{a_l, n - a_r\} \\
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{exp_lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, n - a_r}, y_{k, 0}),
            (x_{k, n -b}, z_{k+1,n-b}))
                &  i \in \{n - a_r + 1, n - b\} \\
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, n - b}, y_{k, n - b}), (x_{k,
            n}, z_{k+1,0}))
                &  i \in \{n - b + 1, n\}
        \end{cases}

    where `linfit` linearly fits value based on two other points; `lin_exp_xy_fit`
    gradually fits combination of linear
    function and exponential function scaled from (0, 1) range and mirrored over y=x
    line;
    `exp_lin_fit` gradually fits combination of exponential function scaled from
    `(0, 1)` range and linear function.

class ExpAdaptiveRFA(AbstractRFA):
    r"""Moves between points in adaptive transition intervals by combining linear and
    exponential function.

    .. image:: /_static/gfx/apidocs/exp_adaptive_rfa.png

    Transition combining linear and exponential function between intervals in
    transition window (part of the interval).
    Transition window is defined in number of samples `a` and divided according to the
    `adaptive_factor`. `adaptive_factor` is inversely proportionally to the change of
    function
    value on both edges of the interval, i.e., if function value has higher change on
    the
    right side of the interval, than on the left side,
    the right side transition window is smaller than the left one.

    The impact of the `adaptive_factor` can be decreased by adjusting `adaptive_smooth`.

    If `a` is not specified, it is obtained based on the transition samples factor
    `alpha`
    multiplied by the number of inserted samples for each interval `n`.
    `a` cannot be lower, than 2 samples. If it is, it's value is changed to correct
    that.

    Left and right transition window is further divided into linear only part and
    combination of
    linear and exponential one. Division is done according to parameter `beta` and
    linear transition window is calculated as `b = beta * a_l`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: 1-D array-like
        Independent variable in strictly increasing order.
    y: 1-D array-like
        Dependent variable.
    n: int
        Number of points oversampled and recreated in the function.
    alpha: float, default: 1.0
        Transition window samples factor for moving between intervals.
    beta: float, default: 0.5
        Linear transition window samples factor.
    a: int, optional
        Transition window samples for moving between intervals.
        If not specified, it is equal to `alpha` * `n`. Cannot be lower than 2.
    adaptive_smooth: float, default: 1.0
        Decreasing impact of `adaptive_factor` by raising it to the power
        `1/adaptive_smooth`.
    exp: float, default: 2.0
        Exponent in exponential transition function.

    Notes
    -----
    This class combines functionality of :func:`LinearAdaptiveOversample` to
    calculate adaptive transition
    window, and :func:`ExpFixedOversample` to combine both linear and exponential
    function to change
    between intervals.

    In particular, for each interval corresponding number of transition samples is
    calculated, respectively,
    and they are denoted as: :math:`a_{k, l}`, :math:`a_{k, r}`, :math:`b_{k, l}`,
    and :math:`b_{k, r}`.


    Based on found transition values, remaining points in function :math:`z = g(x)`
    are calculated
    as a linear combination of transition point and previous value using linear and
    exponential functions.

    Two additional transition points are calculated, corresponding to :math:`x_{k,
    b}` and :math:`x_{k, n - b}`
    denoted as `z_{k, b}` and `z_{k, n-b}`. They are calculated as linear combination
    between
    :math:`z_{k, 0}` and :math:`y_{k, 0}`, and :math:`z_{k+1, 0}` and :math:`y_{k,
    0}`, respectively.

    Then the points in interval are calculated as:

    .. math::
        \begin{cases}
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, 0}, z_{k, 0}), (x_{k, b_{k,
            l}}, z_{k, b_{k, l}})) &   i \in \{0, b_{k, l} - 1\} \\
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_exp_xy_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, b_{k, l}}, z_{k, b_{k,
            l}}), (x_{k, a_{k, l}}, y_{k, 0})) &   i \in \{b_{k, l}, a_{k, l} - 1\} \\
            z_{k,i} = y_{k,i} & i \in \{a_{k, l}, n - a_{k, r}\} \\
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{exp_lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, n - a_{k, r}}, y_{k, 0}),
            (x_{k, n - b_{k, r}}, z_{k+1,n-b_{k,r}}))
                &  i \in \{n - a_{k, r} + 1, n - b_{k,r}\} \\
            z_{k, i} = \mbox{lin_fit}(x_{k, i}, (x_{k, n - b_{k,r}}, y_{k, n - b_{k,
            r}}), (x_{k, n}, z_{k+1,0}))
                &  i \in \{n - b_{k,r} + 1, n\}
        \end{cases}
