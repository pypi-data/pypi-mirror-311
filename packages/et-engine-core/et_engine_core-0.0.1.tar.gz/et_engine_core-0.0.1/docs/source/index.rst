ET Engine Python Core SDK
=========================

This package contains the basic interfaces used to handle client-server interactions via the ET Engine. For most applications, we suggest using the Official ET Engine Python SDK.


============
Installation
============

The Python Core SDK is currently compatible with Python >=3.11.9. We suggest using Conda to create a new environment, for example using the following commands.

.. code-block:: python

   conda create -n engine-sdk-core python=3.11.9
   conda activate engine-sdk-core

Now you can install using pip.

.. code-block:: python

   pip install et-engine-core
