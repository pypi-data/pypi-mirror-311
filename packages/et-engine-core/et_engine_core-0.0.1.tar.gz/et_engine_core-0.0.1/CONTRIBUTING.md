# Contributing Code
We welcome contributions from the developer community. We are still a young company, so the best way to get started is to send us a note at info@exploretech.ai so we can discuss the best way to collaborate. 

You can also just submit a pull request if you like. If you do this, please following these guidelines:

- Try to match the existing style of the codebase
- Use comments as needed 
- Unit tests and functional tests are encouraged
- Include a test case that demonstrates the problem and how your solution solves it
- If the change is an update to the API, ensure that the change is thoroughly documented
