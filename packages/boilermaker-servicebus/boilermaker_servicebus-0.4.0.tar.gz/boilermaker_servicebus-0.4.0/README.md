# Boilermaker

This project is an extremely-lightweight task-runner exclusively for __async Python__ and Azure Service Bus Queues. If you need a fully fledged task-runner, you should consider one of these other projects instead:

- [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/main)
-

## To Install

```sh
pip install "boilermaker-servicebus"
```
