# trolo

A framework for harnessing the power of transformers with YOLO models and other single-shot detectors!

> **Note**: This project is currently in very early development and only supports the D-FINE model architecture.

## Installation

```bash
pip install trolo
```


## Features

- üî• Transformer-enhanced object detection
- üéØ Single-shot detection capabilities  
- ‚ö° High performance inference
- üõ†Ô∏è Easy to use CLI interface

## CLI Usage

The basic command structure is:

```bash
trolo [command] [options]
```


Example inference command:
```bash
trolo infer --model dfine_n_coco.pth --input ./data/images/ --output ./data/outputs/
trolo infer --model dfine_n_coco.pth --input video.mp4
```

Example training command:
```bash
trolo train --model-size large --dataset coco --use-automatic-mixed-precision --number-of-gpus 4
```

For help on available commands:
```bash
trolo --help
```


## Available Models

<details>
<summary><b>D-FINE</b></summary>

The D-FINE model redefines regression tasks in DETR-based detectors using Fine-grained Distribution Refinement (FDR).

Available configurations:
- D-FINE-N: Lightweight model
- D-FINE-S: Small model
- D-FINE-M: Medium model  
- D-FINE-L: Large model
- D-FINE-X: Extra large model

Reference configuration files:
```yaml:trolo/configs/yaml/dfine/dfine_hgnetv2_l_coco.yml
startLine: 1
endLine: 7
```

<summary><b>TROLO-24</b></summary>
**Currently under development.**

**Note**: This is an early work in progress. Many features are still under development.

### Immidiate TODOs
- [ ] Add support for training with passing model and dataset configs separately
- [ ] Allow overriding default nested configs with custom ones in trainer or CLI
- [ ] Add CLI and Pythonic DDP support
- [ ] 1-step multi-GPU training, by simply passing the number of GPUs to the CLI, and the trainer
- [ ] W&B logging
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Docusaurus documentation
