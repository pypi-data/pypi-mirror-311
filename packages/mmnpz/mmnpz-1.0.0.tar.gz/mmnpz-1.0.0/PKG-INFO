**mmnpz** is a small Python package for handling large .npz files.
.npz files are uncompressed zip files containing numpy arrays.
**mmnpz** unlocks their potential as an efficient, standardized
option for storing and accessing large datasets.

Installation
------------

**mmnpz** is available [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mmnpz/).
To install the latest release, run:

```bash
pip install mmnpz
```

Usage
-----

**mmnpz** can write large .npz files incrementally:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import mmnpz
>>> with mmnpz.NpzWriter("test.npz") as f:
>>>     for i in range(10):
>>>         f.write(f"a{i}", np.full(10000, i))
```

**mmnpz** can read large .npz files as memory maps:

```python
>>> import mmnpz
>>> x = mmnpz.load("test.npz")
>>> x["a2"][10:15]
memmap([2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
```

This allows accessing individual excerpts of large datasets [without I/O
overhead](https://mmnpz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/background.html).
