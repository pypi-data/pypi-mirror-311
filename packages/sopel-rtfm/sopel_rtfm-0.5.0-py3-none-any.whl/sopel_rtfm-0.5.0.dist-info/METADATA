# sopel-rtfm

A plugin to suggest documentation links when someone asks a basic question.

## Installing

This plugin is built for Sopel 8.0+.

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-rtfm
```

### Optional extras

Optionally, you can install `sphobjinv[speedup]` for faster searches; this may
or may not work depending on whether your installation of Python includes the
necessary dependencies for building C extensions.


## Configuring

The easiest way to configure `sopel-rtfm` is via Sopel's configuration
wizard—simply run `sopel-plugins configure rtfm` and enter the values for which
it prompts you.

Two settings exist, one of which is required:

```ini
[rtfm]
# Required: URL of the objects.inv file you want `.rtfm` to search
inventory = https://docs.project.site/objects.inv
# Optional, but useful if automatically determining the base URL doesn't work
link_base = https://docs.project.site/
```

## Using

`sopel-rtfm` provides one command:

* `.rtfm` — searches the configured Sphinx object inventory for the best match,
  and outputs a link to its documentation.

## Changelog

### 0.5.0

Changed:
* Require Sopel 8.0+ (#4)
  * Minimum Python version is therefore now 3.8
* Improve logging of inventory & URL settings at startup (#5)

Meta:
* Packaging modernized: goodbye `setup.cfg`, hello `pyproject.toml` (#4)
  * Cleaned up some deprecated usage (`sopel.module`, `datetime.utcnow()`)
  * Tweaked config wizard prompt punctuation


### 0.4.0

Added:
* `.docs` command alias, for when `.rtfm` feels harsh (#2)


### 0.3.0

Added:
* Proper help output for `.rtfm` command (#1)

Changed:
* Prioritize "bigger" object types when sorting results
* Simplify retrieving output URL


### 0.2.0

Added:
* Caching behavior: The configured Sphinx inventory is fetched at startup, and
  re-fetched automatically every 24 hours
* Bot admins can force an update with the new `.rtfmupdate` command


### 0.1.1

Changed:
* Empty/missing query now outputs the docs' base URL instead of an error

Fixed:
* `rtfm_base` was left in `bot.memory` after `shutdown()`


### 0.1.0

Initial release.
