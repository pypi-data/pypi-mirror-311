# moka-py

* * * 

**moka-py** is a Python binding for the highly efficient [Moka](https://github.com/moka-rs/moka) caching library written
in Rust. This library allows you to leverage the power of Moka's high-performance, feature-rich cache in your Python
projects.

## Features

- **Synchronous Cache:** Supports thread-safe, in-memory caching for Python applications.
- **TTL Support:** Automatically evicts entries after a configurable time-to-live (TTL).
- **TTI Support:** Automatically evicts entries after a configurable time-to-idle (TTI).
- **Size-based Eviction:** Automatically removes items when the cache exceeds its size limit using the TinyLFU policy.
- **Concurrency:** Optimized for high-performance, concurrent access in multi-threaded environments.

## Installation

You can install `moka-py` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install moka-py
```

## Quick Start

```python
from time import sleep
from moka_py import Moka


# Create a cache with a capacity of 100 entries, with a TTL of 30 seconds
# and a TTI of 5.2 seconds. Entries are always removed after 30 seconds
# and are removed after 5.2 seconds if there are no `get`s happened for this time.
# 
# Both TTL and TTI settings are optional. In the absence of an entry, 
# the corresponding policy will not expire it.
cache: Moka[str, list[int]] = Moka(capacity=100, ttl=30, tti=5.2)

# Insert a value.
cache.set("key", [3, 2, 1])

# Retrieve the value.
assert cache.get("key") == [3, 2, 1]

# Wait for 5.2+ seconds, and the entry will be automatically evicted.
sleep(5.3)
assert cache.get("key") is None
```

Moka can be used as a drop-in replacement for `@lru_cache()` with TTL + TTI support:

```python
from time import sleep
from moka_py import cached


@cached(maxsize=1024, ttl=10.0, tti=1.0)
def f(x, y):
    print("hard computations")
    return x + y


f(1, 2)  # calls computations
f(1, 2)  # gets from the cache
sleep(1.1)
f(1, 2)  # calls computations (since TTI has passed)
```
