PathNavigator documentation
===========================

``PathNavigator`` is a Python package designed to navigate directories and files efficiently. 
It provides tools to interact with the filesystem, allowing users to create, delete, and 
navigate folders and files, while also maintaining an internal representation of the 
directory structure. Customized shortcuts can be added. The paths are stored as ``Path`` 
objects from `pathlib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>`_, which adapt automatically across platforms.

For quick start, see the `Readme <https://github.com/philip928lin/PathNavigator>`_ page.
