# TexHelper

TexHelper is a Python library designed to assist with various tasks related to LaTeX files, including automating title formatting, processing BibTeX files, and more. It is particularly useful for anyone working with LaTeX documents who needs to handle common formatting issues and improve productivity.

## Features

- **Title Formatting**: Automatically capitalizes the words in titles while respecting common style rules (e.g., only capitalizing the first and last words, and specific important words).
- **BibTeX Processing**: Supports processing and formatting of BibTeX entries (e.g., fixing capitalization in titles).
- **Extensible**: The library is designed to be modular, allowing for easy addition of new features.

## Installation

You can install **TexHelper** directly from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install texhelper
```

## Usage

After installation, you can import and use the functions in your Python code.

### Example: Capitalizing Titles

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `capitalize_title` function, which formats titles according to common capitalization rules.

```python
from texhelper.bibtex import capitalize_title

title = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
formatted_title = capitalize_title(title)
print(formatted_title)
```

**Output:**
```
The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog
```

### Example: Processing a BibTeX Entry

You can also use **TexHelper** to process BibTeX files, applying the correct title capitalization.

```python
from texhelper.bibtex import process_bibtex

bib_content = [
    'author={John Doe},\n',
    'title={the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog},\n',
    'year={2024},\n'
]

processed_bib = process_bibtex(bib_content)
print(''.join(processed_bib))
```

**Output:**
```
author={John Doe},
  title={The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog},
year={2024},
```
