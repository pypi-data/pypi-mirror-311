# Development
## Building the docs

More information about this library can be found in `docs`. The docs can be 
built using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_.

Please make sure you have installed Sphinx in the same environment where 
crabpy\_pyramid is present.

```sh
pip install sphinx sphinxcontrib-httpdomain
pip install -e .
cd docs
make html
```

## Build wheel or sdist

```sh
pip install hatch
hatch build
hatch build -t wheel
hatch build -t sdist
```


## Work with pip-compile / pip-sync

full docs: https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To start, first install pip-tools: 
```sh
pip install pip-tools
```

### uv (optional)

You can also use `uv` and for the remainder of the readme replace `pip`, `pip-compile` or
`pip-sync` by `uv pip`, `uv pip compile` and `uv pip sync`.

`uv` is a very fast replacement for pip-toools. It's optional, but can save a lot of time.
```sh
pip install uv
```

### Install requirements: pip-sync

Note, `pip-sync` also uninstalls everything from the virtualenv which does not belong 
there according to the requirements file. This includes the project itself. You will
have to install `crabpy_pyramid` again after `pip-sync`.
Since the requirements file of pip-sync is still a normal requirements file you can also
use `pip install -r` to install all libraries defined in it. This will not cleanup your
virtualenv and uninstall other libraries.

The compiled requirements files are made in a 3.11 environment.
```sh
pip-sync requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```
`requirements-dev.txt` contains all libraries uncluding those for testing and development.

`requirements.txt` contains only the necessary libraries for running the library.

### Update requirements: pip-compile

```sh
echo -e "\nStarting"
PIP_COMPILE_ARGS="-q --strip-extras --no-header --resolver=backtracking --no-emit-options pyproject.toml"
pip-compile $PIP_COMPILE_ARGS -o requirements.txt;
echo "requirements.txt done"
pip-compile $PIP_COMPILE_ARGS --extra dev -o requirements-dev.txt;
echo "requirements-dev.txt done"
echo "Finished"
```
