DATATOOLBOX
=====================

This is a python package for handling global datasets. It contains the following features:

1. Augumented pandas DataFrames adding meta data
2. Automatic unit conversion and dataframe based computations
3. ID based data structure

This package is under development and serves as a collection of tools around various data analysis packages. 
The package is developed in-house and supported by Climate Analytics gGmbH and therefore mainly used in the context of climate change mitigation.

The included csv-based git database structure allows multi-user access to unified and version-controlled data sets. 
Data access is locally controlled by define data IDs and globally via dataset-IDs.
