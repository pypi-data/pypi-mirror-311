## Outlier Detection for Time-series Data
This package identifies outlier(s) for a given time-series dataset in simple steps. It supports 
day, week, month and quarter level time-series data.

#### DataFrame Arguments:
* First column in the dataframe must be a date column ('YYYY-MM-DD') and the last column a numeric column 
(sum or total count for the time period) to detect outliers using Classical Seasonal Decomposition algorithm.
* Last column must be a numeric column to detect outliers using Moving Average and Z-score algorithm. 

#### Package Functions:
* detect_outliers(df): Detect outliers in a time-series dataframe using seasonal trend decomposition when there 
is at least 2 years of data, otherwise we can use Interquartile Range (IQR) for smaller timeframe.
* detect_outliers_today(df) Detect outliers for the current date in a time-series dataframe.
* detect_outliers_latest(df): Detect latest outliers in a time-series dataframe.
* detect_outliers_iqr(df): Detect outliers in a time-series dataframe when there's less than 2 years of data.
* detect_outliers_moving_average(df): Detect outliers using moving average method. 

#### Diagnostic Plots:
* build_seasonal_plot(df): Build seasonal plot (additive or multiplicative) for a given dataframe.
* build_iqr_plot(df): Build IQR plot for a given dataframe (for less than 2 years of data).
* build_monthwise_plot(df): Build month-wise plot for a given dataframe.
* build_decomposition_results(df): Get seasonal decomposition results for a given dataframe.
* conduct_stationarity_check(df): Conduct stationarity checks for a feature (dataframe's count column).
