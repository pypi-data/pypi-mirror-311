# Model Optimization Workflow
Model Optimization Workflow is a library and workflow tool designed for training and optimizing machine learning models. The main purpose of this library is to streamline the entire process of model training, including data handling, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Overview
This project acts as a framework that manages models by placing them in a container. The library handles essential tasks such as providing folds, retrieving reports, and supplying hyperparameters for model training. The goal is to facilitate the full training and optimization cycle, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Features
1. Data Handling:

- Downloads and processes datasets.
- Splits data into structured datasets.
- Further divides datasets into folds.
- Applies a sliding window mechanism to move between folds, creating new training and validation sets.
2. Container Management:

- Creates a container for model(s) with the required set of folds.
- Manages communication with the container to send folds and receive training reports.
3. Optimization and Evaluation:

- Calculates model scores for Optuna optimization.
- Utilizes Optuna to optimize both model-specific and global hyperparameters.
- Generates detailed reports on optimization and model validation.
## Workflow
1. Data Download and Preparation:

- The project downloads datasets and splits them into multiple folds.
- Folds are then divided into smaller windows that shift incrementally to ensure a thorough validation process.
2. Container Interaction:

- A container is created to encapsulate the model(s).
- The workflow manages the transfer of folds to the container and retrieves training results.
3. Optimization Process:

- Model scores are calculated internally.
- Optuna is used to fine-tune hyperparameters for the model(s) as well as global parameters.
- Generates reports for both the optimization and validation stages, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance.
## Purpose
The purpose of the Model Optimization Workflow project is to provide a reliable and automated solution for model training and hyperparameter optimization. By handling data, managing model containers, and performing automated optimization, this library aims to simplify the machine learning workflow and enhance model performance.
