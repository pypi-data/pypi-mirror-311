Depending on your algorithm, a signal is calculated for every frame of your video (plotted on the left side). In this signal, the peaks are identified and marked with orange dots. You can view them using the slider on the bottom middle.",

IMPORTANT: This limit is applied before other filters like the minimum area. Therefore there may be less than n results. Also it is applied to the local maximum and not the weighted center of mass"
