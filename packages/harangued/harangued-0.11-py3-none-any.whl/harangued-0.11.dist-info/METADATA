Harangued is a small library for managing adding or removing
additional lines to standard (and normally system) configuration
files.

Harangued provides a context manager which can be used
to manage your app additions to a configuration file which
is common with other apps, including other apps using Harangued,
or human editors and make changes to those config files in
their own guarded sections.

Harangued can be used like this:

.. code:: python

    with Haranguer("/path/to/file") as my_lines:
        for line in my_lines.data:
           # Verify line
           pass
        my_lines.data.append("extra line")

This will result in a section being added to the config file
like this.

.. code:: config

    Some config line
    ################## begin Block - Generated by Haranguer ##################
    an existing config line
    extra line
    ################## end   Block - Generated by Haranguer ##################
