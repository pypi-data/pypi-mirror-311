Harangued is small library for managing adding additional lines
to standard (and normally system) configuration files.

Harangued provides a context manager which can be used
to manage your app additions to a configuration file which
is common with other apps, including other apps using Harangued,
or human editors and make changes to those config files in
their own guarded sections.

Harangued can be use like this:

.. code:
    with Haranguer("/path/to/file") as my_lines:
        for line in my_lines.data:
           # Verify line
           pass
        my_lines.data.append("extra line")

This will result is a section being added to the config file
like this.

.. code:
    Some config line
    ################## begin Block - Generated by Haranguer ##################
    an existing config line
    extra line
    ################## end   Block - Generated by Haranguer ##################
