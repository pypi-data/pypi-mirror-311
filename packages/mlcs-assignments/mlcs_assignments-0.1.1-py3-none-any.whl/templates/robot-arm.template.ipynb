    "# Iterative Learning Control for a 2D Robot Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to the 2D Robot Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will implement Iterative Learning Control (ILC) for a two-link planar robot arm. Before we dive into the control algorithm, let's understand the basics of our robot arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The 2D Robot Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-link planar robot arm consists of two rigid links connected by revolute joints. It operates in a 2D plane and is described by the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $l_1$: Length of the first link\n",
    "- $l_2$: Length of the second link\n",
    "- $\\theta_1$: Angle of the first link relative to the horizontal axis\n",
    "- $\\theta_2$: Angle of the second link relative to the first link\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration of the arm can be fully described by the joint angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 End-Effector\n",
    "\n",
    "The end-effector is the point of interest at the end of the robot arm. In our case, it's the tip of the second link. The position of the end-effector in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ can be calculated using forward kinematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the position of the first joint $(x_1, y_1)$ is just the origin $(0, 0)$. We then can calculate the position of the second joint $(x_2, y_2)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_2 = x_1 + l_1 \\cos(\\theta_1)$ - the x-coordinate of the first joint.  \n",
    "$y_2 = y_1 + l_1 \\sin(\\theta_1)$ - the y-coordinate of the first joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering now the second link, the position of the end-effector $(x, y)$ can be calculated as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$x = x_2 + l_2 \\cos(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)$  \n",
    "$y = y_2 + l_2 \\sin(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Drawing the Robot Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to create a function that draws the 2D robot arm given its joint angles. This will help us visualize the arm's movement as we develop our control algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1.3.1\n",
    "Implement the method `joint_positions()` for the class `RobotArm`. A `RobotArm` object represents our robot arm, with the `l_1` and `l_2` attributes of the `RobotArm` being the link lengths and the `theta_1` and `theta_2` attributes - the joint angles.\n",
    "The `joint_positions()` method should return a list of `Point` objects, corresponding to the cartesian coordinates of the joints and the end-effector, with the end-effector coordinates at the very end of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done, the `draw()` method will be able to produce a plot of the robot arm in the current configuration. More precisely, the `draw()` method will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the positions of the joints and the end-effector using the `joint_positions()` method.\n",
    "2. Plot the links as lines.\n",
    "3. Mark the joints and end-effector with points.\n",
    "4. Set appropriate axis limits so that the robot isn't clipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint: You can use `np.cos` and `np.sin` to calculate the cosine and sine values of an angle."

    "## 2. Animating the Robot Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can draw static positions of our robot arm, let's bring it to life with animation. This will help us visualize how the arm moves over time, as well as how our control logic improves throughout the learning process. It's\n",
    "also fun to watch!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Creating an Animation\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an animation of the robot arm moving through a sequence of positions. This will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating a sequence of joint angles.\n",
    "2. Using our `RobotArm.draw()` method for each frame.\n",
    "3. Combining these frames into an animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2.1.1\n",
    "Implement the function `animation_frames_for(robot, joint_angles)` that takes our robot and a sequence of joint angle pairs $(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ and produces a list of frames of the robot arm moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- You can use `robot.draw(show=False)` to generate a frame, without actually showing it in the output.\n",
    "- The `trace=...` argument for the `robot.draw` method can be used to visualize the movement of the end-effector. \n",
    "- The value for the `trace` argument should be a list of points, representing the positions of the end-effector over time. \n",
    "- It may be a good idea to gradually build up the end-effector trace, while you iterate over the joint angles.\n",
    "- Don't forget to return the frames as the result of the function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, the `animate(robot, joint_angles)` function will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the animation frames using the `animation_frames_for` method.\n",
    "2. Combine these frames into a single animation.\n",
    "3. Add a button to the top-left of the plot to play the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will definitely have to verify your implementation in the next exercise, however, feel free to run the `animate()` function on your own now if you want to check your solution."
