# biopb
A place for collecting protobuf definitions for bio-research data. Currently it has only two packages

1. `biopb.ome` Microscopy data representation modeled after [OME-XML](https://ome-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ome-xml/index.html).
2. `biopb.image` Image processing protocols. Current focus is single-cell segmentation, designed originally for the [Lacss](https://github.com/jiyuuchc/lacss/) project.
