To install this package, simply install the package from PyPi

```bash
pip install morgan_course_data
```

## Usage

### Initialize the Data Handler

Start by creating an instance of the MorganCourseData class

(Specify either FALL_2024 or SPRING_2025 as the term)

```python
from morgan_course_data.api import MorganCourseData

morgan_data = MorganCourseData(term="FALL_2024")
```

### Get all Courses

Retrieve all courses from the specified term

```python
fall_courses = morgan_data.get_all_courses()

for course in fall_courses:
    print(course)
```

### Get Courses by Subject Abbrevation

Retrieve all courses under a specified subject

```python
cosc_courses = morgan_data.get_courses_by_subject("COSC")

for course in cosc_courses:
    print(course)
```

### Get Course Sections by Instructor

Retrieve all course sections taught by a instructor

The instructor argument should be formatted as: 'lastName, firstName'

```python
naja_mack_course_sections = morgan_data.get_course_sections_by_instructor("Mack, Naja")

for section in naja_mack_course_sections:
    print(section)
```

### Get All Instructors

Retrieve a list of all instructors and the courses they teach:

```python
instructors = morgan_data.get_all_instructors()

for instructor in instructors:
    print(instructor)
```
