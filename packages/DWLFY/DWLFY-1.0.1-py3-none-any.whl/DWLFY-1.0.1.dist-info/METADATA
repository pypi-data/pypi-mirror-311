```

2. Download a YouTube Video
Use the Downloader class to download a YouTube video by providing its URL.
```python

# Initialize the downloader
downloader = Downloader()

# Example YouTube URL
url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

# Download the video to a specific destination
destination = "/home/user/Downloads"
downloaded_file = downloader.download_video(
    url=url,
    destination=destination,
    format_option="best",  # Specify video quality, e.g., "best" or "worst"
    height=720             # Optional: Max video resolution (e.g., 720p)
