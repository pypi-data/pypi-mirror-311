 Based on the [GOBLIN](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2239/2022/) (**G**eneral **O**verview for a **B**ackcasting approach of **L**ivestock **IN**tensification) LifeCycle Analysis tool, the cbm_runner package generates the data requried for the CBM CFS3 (libcbm_py) tool. It also interfaces with the tool directly, generating results in a single dataframe for all scenarios. 

 The outputs are related to biomass, and dead organic matter. These are summed into a total ecosystem value. 

 The estimated volumns are all in t of C. 



## Installation

Install from git hub. 

```bash
pip install "goblin_cbm_runner@git+https://github.com/GOBLIN-Proj/goblin_cbm_runner.git@main" 

```

Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install goblin_cbm_runner
```

## Usage

The Runner class takes the total afforestation area and divides it evenly across years (calibration year - target year). 

```python
from goblin_cbm_runner.default_runner.runner import Runner
import pandas as pd
import os


def main():
    # path to data
    path = "./data/runner_input"
    results_path = "./data/runner_results"

    # afforestation data for each scenario
    afforest_data = pd.read_csv(
        os.path.join(path, "cbm_afforestation.csv"), index_col=0
    )

    # basic configuration file
    config = os.path.join(path, "cbm_factory.yaml")

    # scenario_data
    sc_data = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path, "scenario_dataframe.csv"))

    # calibration and end point
    calibration_year = 2020

    # instance of the Runner class
    runner = Runner(config, calibration_year, afforest_data, sc_data)

    # generation of aggregated results
    runner.run_aggregate_scenarios().to_csv(os.path.join(results_path, "c_aggregate.csv"))

    # generation of annual flux results
    runner.run_flux_scenarios().to_csv(os.path.join(results_path, "c_flux.csv"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
