def bubblesort(a):

    """Bubblesort Algorithm for sorting a list of numbers in ascending order.

    It takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a sorted list in ascending order. If the argument is not a list, it returns False. If the list is empty, it returns an empty list.

    The algorithm works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. It continues to pass through the list until the list is sorted. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2).

    Parameters:
    a (list): the list of numbers to be sorted

    Returns:
    list: the sorted list in ascending order

    """
    Insertion Sort Algorithm for sorting a list of numbers in ascending order.

    This function sorts a list of numbers using the insertion sort algorithm. It takes a list as input and returns the sorted list in ascending order. If the input is not a list, it returns False. If the list is empty, it returns an empty list.

    The insertion sort algorithm works by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the elements in the sorted portion of the list. If an element is smaller, it is shifted to the correct position within the sorted portion. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2).

    Parameters:
    a (list): The list of numbers to be sorted.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted list in ascending order, or False if the input is not a list.
