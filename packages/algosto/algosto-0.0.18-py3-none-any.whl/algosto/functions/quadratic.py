def quadratic(noise: str = None, custom_noise_fn: Callable = None) -> Tuple[Callable, Callable]:
    """
    Gives the quadratic function and its gradient.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    noise : str
        The type of noise that you want to add to the quadratic function. Values can be ``uniform`` which is a uniforme law on ``[-1, 1]``
        and ``gaussian`` which is a gaussian law of mean ``0`` and standard deviation ``1``.
        You can also add your own noise function by using the ``custom_noise_fn`` parameter.
    
    custom_noise_fn : function
        Define your own noise function that will be added to the quadratic function.
        Its parameter is the vector ``x`` of size ``d`` and it must return a vector of size ``n``.

    Returns
    -------
        objective : function
            The quadratic function.

        grad : function
            The gradient of the quadratic function.

    Examples
    --------
    An example without noise
    
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from algosto.functions import quadratic
    >>> from algosto.constraints import RdSquareConstraint
    >>> from algosto.solvers import SGDSolver
    >>> objective, grad = quadratic()
    >>> ct = RdSquareConstraint(2, 10, np.zeros(2))
    >>> solver = SGDSolver(ct, objective, grad)
    
    An example with custom noise
    
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from algosto.functions import quadratic
    >>> from algosto.constraints import RdSquareConstraint
    >>> from algosto.solvers import KieferWolfowitzSolver
    >>> def noise(x):

    >>> objective, grad = quadratic(custom_noise_fn = noise)
    >>> ct = RdSquareConstraint(2, 10, np.zeros(2))
    >>> solver = KieferWolfowitzSolver(ct, objective)
