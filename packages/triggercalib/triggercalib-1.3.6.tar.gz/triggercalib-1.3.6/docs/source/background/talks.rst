Talks on TISTOS
=======================================================

There have now been several talks discussing central RTA TISTOS studies.
The list below is a full indexing of these talks, each linked and with a brief summary.


TISTOS efficiency plans, 23.05.24
-------------------------------------------------------

TISTOS efficiency plans, Jamie Gooding - RTA WP4/5 Meeting (23.05.24)

**Contribution in Indico:** `<https://indico.cern.ch/event/1401310/#6-tistos-efficiency-plans>`_

This talk lays out the plans for central RTA TISTOS studies and reintroduces the TISTOS method.


Trigger efficiencies in CalibMon, 20.06.24
-------------------------------------------------------

Trigger efficiencies in CalibMon, Piera Battista - RTA WP4/5 Meeting (20.06.24)

**Contribution in Indico:** `<https://indico.cern.ch/event/1401312/#9-trigger-efficiencies-in-cali>`_

Whilst not directly related to the ``HltEff`` toolset, this talk gives a nice overview of the work implementing real-time HLT1 TISTOS efficiencies in the CalibMon monitoring framework.


.. _june WP4 meeting:

Update on TISTOS efficiencies, 11.07.24
-------------------------------------------------------

Update on TISTOS efficiencies, Jamie Gooding - RTA WP4/5 Meeting (11.07.24)

**Contribution in Indico:** `<https://indico.cern.ch/event/1435852/#8-update-on-tistos-efficiencie>`_

This contribution contains the first 'batch' of HLT1 TISTOS efficiencies in Bu2Jpsi(mm)K decay channel.
These results include preliminary data-MC and 2024-Run 2 comparisons, in binnings of B transverse momentum and B lifetime.
Additionally, efficiencies in 2024 data are calculated per-fill, for fills ~9470 - ~9720.


Preliminary offline trigger efficiency studies with TISTOS, 26.07.24
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preliminary offline trigger efficiency studies with TISTOS, Jamie Gooding - RTA-DPA General Meeting (26.07.24)

**Contribution in Indico:** `<https://indico.cern.ch/event/1416670/#5-preliminary-offline-trigger>`_

This talk extends the results of the previous talk to include the Bd2D(Kpipi)pi decay channel.
Further emphasis was placed upon the relative performance of HLT1 compared to the combined L0 and HLT1 in Run 2.


Validation of TISTOS in 2024, 01.08.24
-------------------------------------------------------

Validation of TISTOS in 2024, Maxim Lysenko - RTA WP4/5 Meeting (01.08.24)

**Contribution in Indico:** `<https://indico.cern.ch/event/1442911/#13-validation-of-tistos-in-202>`_

This talk covers studies validating the TISTOS approach for Run 3.
The talk also presents the sideband subtraction, fit-and-count and *sWeight* methods for retrieving signal counts from samples.
