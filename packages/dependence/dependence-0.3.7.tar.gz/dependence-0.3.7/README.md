This project provides a Command Line Interface and library for inspecting
and updating python project dependency versions in setup.cfg, pyproject.toml,
and requirements.txt files.

## Installation

You can install `dependence` with pip:

```shell
pip3 install dependence
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```console
$ dependence -h
Usage:
  dependence <command> [options]

Commands:
  update                      Update requirement versions in the specified
                              files to align with currently installed versions
                              of each distribution
  freeze                      Print dependencies inferred from an installed
                              distribution or project, in a similar format
                              to the output of `pip freeze`.
```

#### dependence update

This command will update version specifiers for
all package requirements in your setup.cfg, pyproject.toml, tox.ini,
or requirements.txt files to match currently installed versions of each
distribution (matching the existing granularity, and only for *inclusive*
specifiers—so where the comparator is "~=", "==", ">=", or "<=", but not where
the comparator is ">", "<", or "!=").

```console
$ dependence update -h
usage: dependence update [-h] [-i IGNORE] [-aen ALL_EXTRA_NAME]
                           path [path ...]

Update requirement versions in the specified files to align with currently
installed versions of each distribution.

positional arguments:
  path                  One or more local paths to a setup.cfg,
                        setup.cfg, and/or requirements.txt file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IGNORE, --ignore IGNORE
                        A comma-separated list of distributions to ignore
                        (leave any requirements pertaining to the package
                        as-is)
  -aen ALL_EXTRA_NAME, --all-extra-name ALL_EXTRA_NAME
                        If provided, an extra which consolidates the
                        requirements for all other extras will be
                        added/updated to setup.cfg or setup.cfg
                        (this argument is ignored for requirements.txt
                        files)
```

Example:

```bash
dependence update -aen all setup.cfg pyproject.toml tox.ini
```

#### dependence freeze

```console
$ dependence freeze -h
usage: dependence freeze [-h] [-e EXCLUDE] [-er EXCLUDE_RECURSIVE] [-nv NO_VERSION]
                         [-do] [--reverse] [-d DEPTH]
                         requirement [requirement ...]

This command prints dependencies inferred from an installed distribution or project, in
a similar format to the output of `pip freeze`, except that all generated requirements
are specified in the format "distribution-name==0.0.0" (including for editable
installations). Using this command instead of `pip freeze` to generate requirement
files ensures that you don't bloat your requirements files with superfluous
distributions.

positional arguments:
  requirement           One or more requirement specifiers (for example: "requirement-
                        name", "requirement-name[extra-a,extra-b]", ".[extra-a,
                        extra-b]" or "../other-editable-package-directory[extra-a,
                        extra-b]) and/or paths to a setup.py, setup.cfg,
                        pyproject.toml, tox.ini or requirements.txt file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        A distribution (or comma-separated list of distributions) to
                        exclude from the output
  -er EXCLUDE_RECURSIVE, --exclude-recursive EXCLUDE_RECURSIVE
                        A distribution (or comma-separated list of distributions) to
                        exclude from the output. Unlike -e / --exclude, this argument
                        also precludes recursive requirement discovery for the
                        specified packages, thereby excluding all of the excluded
                        package's requirements which are not required by another (non-
                        excluded) distribution.
  -nv NO_VERSION, --no-version NO_VERSION
                        Don't include versions (only output distribution names) for
                        packages matching this/these glob pattern(s) (note: the value
                        must be single-quoted if it contains wildcards)
  -do, --dependency-order
                        Sort requirements so that dependents precede dependencies
  --reverse             Print requirements in reverse order
  -d DEPTH, --depth DEPTH
                        Depth of recursive requirement discovery
```
