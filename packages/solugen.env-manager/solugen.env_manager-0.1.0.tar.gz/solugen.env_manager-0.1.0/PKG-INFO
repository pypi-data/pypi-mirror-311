# Environment Setup for `env_manager`

To properly use this library, ensure your project contains the following files in its root directory:

1. **`.env.dev`**

   - Used for development environment variables.
   - **Important**: Add this file to `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive data.

2. **`.env.prod`**

   - Used for production environment variables.
   - **Important**: Add this file to `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive data.

3. **`.env.example`**
   - A template file that details the required environment variables and their structure.
   - **Do not add this file to `.gitignore`**, as it serves as documentation for other developers, and more importantly - it's necessary for the funtionality, as it loads the key names.

## Key Guidelines

- **Never use quotes** (`"` or `'`) in environment variable values. This ensures compatibility and avoids parsing issues.

---

## Running in Development Mode

To run the application in development mode:

- Explicitly set the environment variable `FLASK_DEV_ENV`.
- The value of `FLASK_DEV_ENV` can be arbitrary (any value is acceptable).

```bash
export FLASK_DEV_ENV=true
```
