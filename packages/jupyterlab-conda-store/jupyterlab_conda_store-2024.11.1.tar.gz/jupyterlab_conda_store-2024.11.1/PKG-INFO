A JupyterLab extension for [conda-store][conda-store-repo].

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is only compatible with JupyterLab `>= 4.0`.

## Installation üì¶

### Pre-requisites

You will need to have [conda-store][conda-store-repo] installed and running on your local computer to use this extension. As well as:

- `JupyterLab >= 4.0`
- Python `>= 3.8`

You can install the extension with pip:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-conda-store
```

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab-conda-store
```

> [!NOTE]
> Starting on version `2024.3.1`, this extension is only compatible with JupyterLab `>= 4.0`, use version `2024.1.1` for use with JupyterLab `3.x`.

## Installing the development version üöÄ

### Pre-requisites

1. You will need to have [NodeJS `> 18`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your local computer to build the extension package.
2. Python `>= 3.8` and `pip`.

### Building and linking the extension

> [!NOTE]
> The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` in the commands below.

1. Clone this repository to your local computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/conda-incubator/jupyterlab-conda-store.git
   ```

2. Change to the `jupyterlab-conda-store` directory:

   ```bash
    cd jupyterlab-conda-store
   ```

3. Create a new conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml

   # activate the environment
   conda activate jupyterlab-conda-store
   ```

4. Install the package in development mode:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -e .
   ```

5. Now you'll need to link the development version of the extension to JupyterLab and rebuild the Typescript source:

   ```bash
   # Install the extension dependencies
   jlpm install
   # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
   jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
   ```

6. On the first installation, or after making some changes, to visualize them in your local JupyterLab re-run the following command:

   ```bash
   # Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
   jlpm run build
   ```

7. Run JupyterLab and check that the installation worked:

   ```bash
   # Run JupyterLab
   jupyter lab
   ```

> [!TIP]
> At times you might need to clean your local repo with the command `npm run clean:slate`. This will clean the repository, and re-install and rebuild.

To lint files as you work on contributions, you can run:

```bash
jlpm run lint:check
```

### Uninstalling the development version

1. Remove the extension:

   ```bash
   pip uninstall jupyterlab-conda-store
   ```

2. In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
   command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
   folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `jupyterlab-conda-store` within that folder.

## Release

To create a jupyterlab-conda-store release:

1. Open a `new_release` issue in the [repository][jupyterlab-conda-store-repo] and fill in the release details.
2. Follow the steps in the new release checklist.

> [!TIP]
> Follow the steps in [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) to ensure all is working as expected.
