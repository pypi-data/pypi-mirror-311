## Description of the `pytreebuilder` Project

### Objective
The `pytreebuilder` project aims to simplify the creation of project structures using a text-based structure description file. It allows developers to quickly and easily generate consistent and well-organized project structures.

### Key Features
- Automatic creation of directories and files from a structure description file.
- Logging configuration to track actions performed by the module.
- Error handling to ensure smooth and uninterrupted execution.
- Update mode to create only new files and directories without overwriting existing ones.

### Detailed Description of Functionalities

#### 1. Automatic Creation of Project Structures
The `pytreebuilder` module allows for the automatic creation of project structures from a structure description file. This enables developers to quickly and easily generate consistent and well-organized project structures.

#### 2. Update Mode
The module includes an update mode (`update_mode`) that allows for the creation of only new files and directories without overwriting existing ones. This ensures that existing files and directories are not modified unless the user provides consent.

#### 3. Logging Configuration
The module configures a logging system to track the actions performed. Logs are recorded in a `pytreebuilder.log` file located in the `logs` directory. This helps keep track of the actions performed by the module and facilitates debugging in case of issues.

#### 4. Error Handling
The module handles errors to ensure smooth and uninterrupted execution. For example, it handles file not found errors and general exceptions, logging error messages in the log file.

#### 5. Command Line Arguments
The module accepts several command line arguments to customize its behavior:
- `-t` or `--tree-file-path` : Path to the structure description file (required).
- `-u` or `--update` : Run in update mode to create only new files and directories without overwriting existing ones.
- `-v` or `--version` : Show the program's version number and exit.

#### 6. Creation of Files and Directories
The module creates files and directories based on the description provided in the structure file. It checks if files and directories already exist and asks for user validation before overwriting them, unless the update mode is enabled.

#### 7. Example Project Structure
The module can create complex project structures from description files. For example, the file `trees/any_project_tree.txt` can contain the following structure:

## Any Project Structure
The structure description file `trees/any_project_tree.txt` contains the following structure:

<div style="position: relative; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    <pre>
anyproject/
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; anyproject/
&#x2502;   &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; __init__.py
&#x2502;   &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; anyproject.py
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; tests/
&#x2502;   &#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; __init__.py
&#x2502;   &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; test_anyproject.py
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; setup.py
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; README.md
&#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; LICENSE
    </pre>
</div>

<script>
    document.charset = "UTF-8";
</script>

#### 8. Installation and Usage
The module can be installed locally or via the internet. Once installed, it can be used to generate project structures by running Python scripts that utilize the `PyTreeBuilder` class.

#### 9. Unit Testing
The module includes unit tests to verify its functionality. Tests can be run using the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

#### 10. Documentation and Support
The module is accompanied by detailed documentation and a README file to help users understand its functionality and use it effectively. For questions or assistance, users can contact the project author via GitHub.

### Any Project Structure
The structure description file `trees/any_project_tree.txt` contains the following structure:

<div style="position: relative; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    <pre>
anyproject/
&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; anyproject/
