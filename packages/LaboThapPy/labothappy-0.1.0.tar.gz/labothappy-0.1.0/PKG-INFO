# LaboThapPy: A Thermodynamic Modelling Library

**LaboThapPy** is an open-source Python library that consolidates a wide range of thermodynamic models developed over years of research at the University of LiÃ¨ge. Its primary purpose is to provide a standardized framework for detailed thermodynamic system and component modeling.

## Why LaboThapPy?

At the University of LiÃ¨ge's Thermodynamic Laboratory, we noticed a recurring issue:  
- Identical or similar models were being recreated across different software and codes.  
- Some models were lost when researchers left.  

**LaboThapPy** was created to address these challenges by:  
- Establishing a shared repository of thermodynamic models.  
- Providing a standardized framework for model implementation.
