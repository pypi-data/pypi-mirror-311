## Planned updates

### • Add more methods for CI for the difference between two proportions
Currently implemented only two low-quality methods: **Z-test pooled** and **Z-test unpooled**. **Miettinen and Nurminen’s Likelihood Score Test** was implemented, but likely in a wrong way.

Description of the R library "Exact" has some references to scientific publications that describe alternative methods for CI for the difference between two proportions.

### • Toolkit for *mean* and *standard deviation*
Add toolkit for studying CI methods for other statistics as well, such as *mean*, *standard deviation*, etc.



## Optional updates / suggestions

### • Change all important output from printing to logging, except tqdm progress bar
